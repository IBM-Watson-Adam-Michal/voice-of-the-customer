The <Product> should be <Descriptor> than it currently is so that it is easier to mount,Enhancement
It should learn my favorite channels over time.,Enhancement
<Descriptor> <Product> but would really benefit from a sturdier base.,Enhancement

"The <Feature> is <Descriptor> and feels somewhat ""cheap.""",Feature
Something that sounds small but will drive you nuts is the remote.,Feature
don't like the start up lag time.,Feature
native set sound quality isn't very good,Feature
terrible Android TV experience,Feature
Clearly their software is buggy and somehow messes up the Audio out.,Feature
 Sharp only lets you access the internet sites they picked - NO WEB BROWSING You can not access Amazon Prime,Feature
Buggy and troubled setup,Feature
The <Product> has really <Feature> sound to begin with and you have to adjust it when switching from tv to other devices.,Feature

 The <Feature> consists of two <Descriptor> <Feature> that are very likely to break off,Feature
the color on this model and the ability to adjust it leaves much to be desired.,Feature
"The built in Wi-Fi was poor,",Feature
<Descriptor> <Feature>,Feature
Poorly made. WiFi card is not grounded/will not connect to your wireless and there is no ethernet port to bypass this issue. ,Feature

Very Poor Remote...takes a very long time to go between channels.,Feature
Terrible glare from light behind or from side.,Feature
Buggy smart software that crashes and reboots irregularly.,Feature
The most remarkable quality I've found with the television is its <Descriptor> <Feature>.,Feature
Set up is pretty much self explanatory and you have a minimal amount of selections to make and the TV does the rest to set itself up.,Feature
"<Consumer> am impressed with the resolution and clarity, since <Product> is a brand I haven't heard of. Visually very impressive, good clean resolution.",Feature

Fastest ON TV I've seen in a long time,Feature
Every time I watch a program or a movie I experience the beauty of this HD screen. It's almost as if you have been sucked in by the TV and seeing everything in real life!,Feature

"his tv has been wonderful for me. The picture quality is above average, the settings we're easy to configure,",Feature
" It prompted me very intuitively. One thing I discovered a bit later is that under the center front of the TV itself, there is a switch",Feature
Has a true native 1080P capability in a small 22 inch LED monitor. Smallest <Descriptor> <Feature> with native 1080p for tight areas.,Feature
"Thin, light, easy to set up, navigation through menu is simple. Bright and colorful ",Feature

"This television was working for about 24 hours worth of viewing, then the picture faded into bright green and white. Completely unusable.",Issue
Within the first month I was having issues with the video and audio not working. ,Issue
After about a week of that the audio went completely out. I contacted sharp and opened a case. It took them about a month but they sent a TV repair man out to replace the mother board.,Issue
had to return it due to large scratch on the screen,Issue

"The first week of Febuary the scrambling and distortion began to get worse, lasting longer and longer, until it was only scrambling when you turned on the set. ",Issue
"Also, as of 1/18/2016 the <Product> now flickers slightly until <Consumer> tap it on its side.",Issue
Dead pixels throughout and the right side of the screen was dead. Huge disappointment.,Issue
"But the annoying thing is, the first one I got, there were two gray shadow area at the low center of the screen, they were too obvious to be ignored. So after another week of waiting, I got a replacement. But I found there's a dead pixel surrounding by a 'bubble' underneath the panel, just right after I spent half an hour to get it mounted on the wall. It looks like a bubble under a window screen.",Issue
