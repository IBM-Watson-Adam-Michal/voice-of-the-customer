I also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Customer Service,
"After speaking to several people and being disconnected once, Samsung arranged to have a local authorized repair technician come to my house and replace the TV screen on November 17.",Customer Service,
I was on the phone for a total of two hours with Samsung and their agents to get the entire problem resolved.,Customer Service,
"I thought maybe I would need a new one-connect box to fix this, but Samsung support (1) checked that I had the latest software, and (2) had me unplug the TV while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Customer Service,
"Contacted Samsung and they deemed it to have ""physical damage"" from shipping and refused to repair it.",Customer Service,
Their customer service is beyond horrible.,Customer Service,
They will do everything possible to deny a warranty claim.,Customer Service,
"If you were to order this tv directly through samsung's website, it'll ship w/in 1-3 business days, but the part that's essential to the tvs functionality takes anywhere from 5-15 business days?",Customer Service,
No problem getting it hooked up but Samsung helped me with the final setup.,Customer Service,
Very kind personnel to work with,Customer Service,
"Created a service request and was called the next morning, the robot-person on the phone asked me to repeat all of the above, it's like they didn't hear the entire story I just told them.",Customer Service,
Then then said they would be closing the service request and sending me an e-mail with troubleshooting steps (literally the same as I had already performed) and I will need to watch my TV on these settings (lvl 7 backlight) for 2-3 WEEKS and then it's MY responsibility to call them back and reference the closed service request ticket.,Customer Service,
Service is absolutely terrible.,Customer Service,
The service was fast and excellent.,Customer Service,
I was listening to Sirius radio and had it on 75 and it was clear and loud for a TV.,Customer Service,
Samsung has the best ever customer service people on their team that I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with!!,Customer Service,
"Had to call customer service for some help, they were not overly friendly.",Customer Service,
The TCL Customer service reps were rather clipped in response to questions.,Customer Service,
I spent hours on the phone with their customer service who immediately placed the blame on my internet service and would not deviate from that script.,Customer Service,
Talking to their customer service it was obvious they were not about to go off their script or have anyone come service the TV.,Customer Service,
I think their customer service is designed to deny any issues and delay any real service calls until the TV is out of warranty.,Customer Service,
I called TCL customer support they told me to check if it was on MUTE .. Of course it was not the TV was broken so i had to return it,Customer Service,
customer service I explained I have work and school and cannot stay home to return it she said okay I will receive a refund but I never received one,Customer Service,
"Customer service, however, was fantastic. Returning my first TV was easy, and I was immediately sent another that works beautifully.",Customer Service,
Set up takes a little while - don't hesitate to call their customer service if you have any issues they were awesome (I wasn't scrolling far enough to see what I needed).,Customer Service,
The TCL company send an email telling me to contact them and they would tell me how to use this television but I think because of the weekend I have not had a reply as yet.,Customer Service,
"My husband had a few questions so he had to call customer service twice and he said they had the best customer service he's ever dealt with, and in the 63 years he's lived he's dealt with a lot of customer service.",Customer Service,
"CL customer service was great, and they sent a brand new TV along with a technician to set it up, and take back the defective one.",Customer Service,
Really disappointed with this product and the customer service.,Customer Service,
It I've been tossed from TCL customer service to Roku customer service to Xfinity customer service - seriously wasted 5 hours of my life!,Customer Service,
"called TCL customer service (who were very prompt and helpful by the way) and they stated that this model (28in) only has 2, but all other models have 4 mounting screw points on the back side.",Customer Service,
UPDATE TO 5 STARS BECAUSE OF FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE.,Customer Service,
"I'M GETTING ANOTHER TV, A BIGGER ONE, AND THEY ARE JUST A JOY TO WORK WITH. WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO MAKE THIS RIGHT FOR ME.",Customer Service,
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, JUST GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM.",Customer Service,
I contacted their customer service department. Thusly were actually very nice and very helpful. ,Customer Service,
Called Amazon and told me to call TCL because it's been more than a month since I bought it. Called TCL and after doing all the absurd instructions they hung up the phone. Pathetic.,Customer Service,
"So I called the included toll-free customer service number, spoke to a USA-based customer service rep and, after verifying my purchase details with him, was told that a complete accessory kit would be sent to me at no charge.",Customer Service,
"So as far as I'm concerned, the TCL customer service experience was excellent, professional, easy to understand, knowledgeable and swift. Can't ask for more than that.",Customer Service,
"Giving this a 3 because since it cost so much, I can't afford my herpes meds",Price,
I find this service to be a bit over-priced ,Price,
The quality at first glance is higher than expected for such a cheap TV.,Price,Feature
"f it fails then your brand new, expensive tv is useless",Price,
"The cables are about a $100 a pop (plus tax), and they are worth it.",Price,
Absolutely worth it ,Price,
Very expensive,Price,
"The smart operating system is not worth the extra money, because their is barely any apps and the operating system is hard to operate.",Price,Feature
his TV is so good I can't believe it doesn't cost a lot more.,Price,
was extremely disappointed when I found out that the estimated annual energy cost was $55,Price,
When looking over the photos again I saw the Energy Guide cost of $55 a year,Price,
"ou can get an 82"" Smart TV at Costco for not much above $2k, so you may wonder why this 85"" Smart TV costs $45,000",Price,
"YES this TV really costs 39,998.",Price,
"So really the TV only cost $25,000 so my wife wasn't nearly as pissed at me as when I originally told her about purchasing the TV",Price,
"After unpackaging the TV, I happened to notice it costs $55 per year in energy costs",Price,
"With the price having came down by $5002 i felt i had no excuse not to, especially as my budget was $2 more.",Price,
I thought the shipping costs were a bit high.,Price,
"This beaute costs 55$ a year in energy,",Price,
"The TV was only $39,779.99 more expensive than the one I was currently using",Price,
"If you buy it now you save 11% of the cost, which is a whole 5000 dollars",Price,
"TV probably only cost you 100.00 or less to make, the price is RIDICULOUS!",Price,
This flat screen cost about 100.00 to make,Price,
"Considering the (approx.) 27,000$ difference in price",Price,
I sold my testicles and kidneys and went bankrupt to buy this tv,Price,
"It overdraw my account by $39,989 good thing I got overdraft protection.",Price,
I sold my liver and refinanced my house to buy this television.,Price,
At first I was reluctant to go forward with the purchase due to the price,Price,
at this price what do you have to lose?,Price,
"After I used up the rest of my trust fund, sold one of kidneys, and became homeless, I joined the military to pay off my debt! ",Price,
Quite the price tag though.,Price,
Anyway I bought one of these last week when I saw the price finally dropped to 32 grand.,Price,
I spent $3500 for this tv and it's nothing but an overpriced HDTV that's really not that impressive.,Price,
"I was on the edge of buying this but there was no way I could've ever afforded the $24,999.99 retail price.",Price,
One of you rich people wanna buy me 1 lol,Price,
For the money I expected a lot more.,Price,
"I'm finding hard to believe that someone would actually pay $20,000 for a tv.",Price,
If it is in your budget this is a fantastic set.,Price,
If you can afford this just do it,Price,
am $4k invested in this bad boy.,Price,
The price is high but worth it.,Price,
"I had to put my wife out to work the corner streets for six weeks straight to get this, but it was worth every penny",Price,
The TV was a bargain for what I paid,Price,
The video quality is very good for its price,Feature,Price
At its current price of 199 dollars - NO WAY.,Price,
Samsung claims that these 10-bit panels can produce 64x times more accurate color and sharper resolution thanks to the Nano Crystal color display compare to current 8-bit UHD panels from other brands.,Feature,
The JS8500 includes the One Connect Mini as oppose to the 9000 series which include the One Connect Box with more input options and future proof of the hardware.,Feature,
"The amount of detail, color and the deepest blacks are some of the best I have ever seen on a LED display.",Feature,
Sharpness controls are tight and for those who rarely love 240hz Motion Rate this set is almost halo-free.,Feature,
"The sound from this TV set is very good, at least you can get clear dialogue and crisp sound from such a narrow frame, but for those who like it LOUD!",Feature,
The Nano Crystals really make a difference on the colors.,Feature,
The vivid picture does change a little bit but im sure it is to account for the refresh speeds.,Feature,
The colors are so vibrant its hard to look away.,Feature,
This TV is an LED edge lit TV.,Feature,
"Also, the 3D is awesome.",Feature,
Color depth and clarity is excellent and I haven't noticed any motion lag.,Feature,
"BACKLIGHT...it's edge lit, and terrible at trying to dim sections that are dark, and light up the sections that are not.",Feature,
there were streaks of backlight at the bottom center portion of my tv angling 45 degrees upward.,Feature,
"Also the color is very impressive, properly calibrated this is another impressive aspect to this set.",Feature,
"Lastly for the pros, this is a very good looking tv, with real metal around the bezel and stand, and if you care about looks, this is a nice plus to have in a set.",Feature,
"Cons: this has a very reflective screen, so if you have it in a room with lots of windows or light sources, be aware that you will see them reflected in the screen.",Feature,
"You can still enjoy the content, as the screen can get very bright, but if you are bothered by this be aware.",Feature,
The picture quality is beyond what I expected!!!,Feature,
The first thing I would like to say is that this TV does NOT have any input ports on any side panel as depicted in the photos.,Feature,
Both the shipping carton and the product label on the rear of the TV clearly identify this TV as a UN24H4000 model.,Feature,
"It's not great, and speaker volume is marginal, but both work well in a small room.",Feature,
I was shocked to learn that this TV doesn't have a headphone jack.,Feature,
Here's what I think: The TV itself is very light.,Feature,
The feet are small and hardly visible so would be essentially 'invisible' if used.,Feature,
The picture is very sharp.,Feature,
Better dimming options,Feature,
"Upon unboxing the UN50JS7000, you get the stand and a few screws",Feature,
The second one has clouds/lights in the corners so bad it looks like I'm looking thru one of those videos replicating someone drunk.,Feature,
I loved the deep color contrast,Feature,
Great resolution! Easy set up. Decent audio. Easy input navigation.,Feature,
You may need to adjust brightness to your liking but otherwise the settings were perfect for me.,Feature,
i can see at least 6 blue marks in different areas of the screen!,Feature,
The quality of the picture is good--not great and the sound quality is clear.,Feature,
"So glad I went to the 4K. The clarity, color and picture is amazing. ",Feature,
good but very reflective.,Feature,
"Color ls all different on every scene. Faces are red then gray.colors close look neon,but",Feature,
"other scenes dull. White is gray,black ls dark gray",Feature,
EXCEPTIONALLY PLEASED WITH THIS TELEVISION!!,Feature,
The colors are vibrant & the display is sharp.,Feature,
I like that the border is very small so you get maximum viewing area.,Feature,
"The colors are really better than the other samsung TVs, maybe the best apart from the expensive OLED.",Feature,
The Samsung TV is very sturdy,Feature,
the TV has a very good display,Feature,
The samsung TV can easily be mounted,Feature,
picture quality is good,Feature,
Colors are good,Feature,
Can easily be mounted,Feature,
