Once you properly calibrate your set be ready to be amazed.,Sentiment,
"<Consumer> watched The <Feature>, Pacific Rim and Transformers 4: Age of <Company>, three of my favorite Reference movies on Blu Ray.",Sentiment,
The <Feature> <Product> is easy to navigate and use.,Feature,
<Consumer> considered both the <Product> but I'm not a fan of curved <Product>'s.,Feature,Comparison

Once you <Product> over to game mode though it <Descriptor>.,Feature,
<Consumer> did an awful lot of research before buying a <Product> in this <Price> and through all my reading I saw that Hight <Feature> (<Descriptor>) was extremely important to future proof your investment and this TV has it.,Feature,Sentiment
The other <Product> <Consumer> looked very closely at was the new <Company> model in the same <Descriptor> set.,Sentiment,Comparison
Both had <Descriptor> <Feature> but the HDR coupled with the slightly better picture in my opinion <Consumer> chose this model.,Feature,Comparison
<Consumer> know many people say there isn't much 4K content out right now and that is fairly true.,Other,
But <Consumer> have watched a fair number or blu rays the past two weeks and they look stunning.,Sentiment,
<Consumer> turned on the UHD upscale and it creates a far <Descriptor> picture than my prior 50 inch LED 1080p <Product>.,Feature,Comparison

The <Feature> are so vibrant its hard to look away.,Feature,
The <Company> UN65JS8500FXZA TV arrived on November 12.,Other,

"Now that the <Feature> has been replaced, the <Product> <Descriptor>.",Feature,
<Consumer> am very pleased with the final result.,Sentiment,

Please let <Consumer> know if you have any questions.,Other,
<Consumer> normally look to upgrade every 2-3 years and this process is usually a very simple one - checkout the offerings from <Company> & <Company> and select the best option.,Sentiment,
"But other advances in technology, both those that are here and those that are arriving soon (hopefully) made this process much more involved and a bit befuddling at times.",Sentiment,
<Consumer>'m still not all that sold on 4k but the <Descriptor> <Feature> are only available on <Feature> so you have to take a close look at what's available in this space.,Feature,
"And while 10-bit panels, wider color gamuts, nano-crystals/Triluminous displays, etc. are <Feature>, none of <Customer_Service> would have changed my original plan for a 2014 1080P set.",Feature,
What did was HDR because <Consumer> believe that could be a game changer.,Sentiment,
"<Product> also <Feature> two <Company> models, the <Product> or <Feature>, and <Consumer> don't think you can go wrong with either one.",Sentiment,Comparison
The <Feature> is <Descriptor> and has <Descriptor> <Feature> but neither of those was a concern for <Consumer>.,Feature,Comparison
But it also has the full OCB for better future upgradeability so that was worth considering.,Feature,
"But you can't upgrade the panel, so <Consumer> would rather use the $500 difference in <Price> along with the future evolution kit upgrade ($400+) and whatever you can sell the <Product> for and put that towards a new <Product> when the time comes.",Sentiment,
"Anyway, it's only been a few days but so far <Consumer> am extremely happy with the <Product>.",Sentiment,
<Feature> was a breeze and the <Feature> from <Descriptor>.,Feature,

But any of these can be easily upgraded and are not <Feature> for <Consumer>.,Sentiment,
Now <Consumer>'d like to mention a few <Feature> that might save some folks a little aggravation and maybe result in more accurate reviews.,Other,
"First, <Consumer> did experience one issue with this set which was some flickering/flashlighting on the bottom of the <Feature> that was very noticeable when watching movies in letterbox format.",Sentiment,
But sometimes this is caused by the screws being over-tightened during the mfg.,Other,
"process, so <Consumer> loosened the 4 bottom screws by about a 1/4 turn (one needed more) and the <Product> has not returned.",Sentiment,
Something to try before returning it.,Other,
"Second, if you have satellite like <Consumer> do (DirecTV) you should test your signal strength to make sure you don't have any issues because this can greatly impact picture <Feature> on any set.",Sentiment,
This is <Descriptor> <Feature> with <Descriptor>.,Sentiment,
You also want to make sure the cable/satellite box is configured to allow the <Product> to do ALL the upscaling/processing.,Sentiment,
With DTV this means Resolutions should all be checked with <Descriptor> set to ON and <Feature> format set to <Feature>.,Sentiment,
"<Consumer> would also recommend turning off all of the following on the <Product>, at least initially - Instant <Feature>/Smart Security/Anti-virus.",Sentiment,
"<Product> can <Feature> problems with streaming, shutoffs, etc.",Other,
so try these individually after you have everything else setup/dialed in.,Other,
<Consumer> know they say you shouldn't professionally calibrate it until after <Feature> so maybe this is related.,Other,
<Consumer> also need to give a couple major kudos to <Company>.,Other,
"First, they <Price> <Feature> the shipment which is a service that some places charge $30-75 for and others don't even offer.",Other,
"And second, they took care of <Consumer> when <Company> not only extended the original sale past 6/13, but then included a free soundbar or 24 <Product> with every purchase.",Other,
Still enjoying the new <Product> and decided to have the set calibrated.,Other,
A lot of people have reviewed this set in detail.,Other,

"<Consumer> think most people will use this <Product> with one or more HDMI devices -- either an A/V receiver, set top box, Blu-Ray player, etc.",Sentiment,
"After <Feature>, <Consumer> got a couple of messages about problems with the HDMI connections.",Sentiment,
<Consumer> think these were due to the One <Feature> cable being loose.,Sentiment,

This cleared the problem.,Other,
 <Consumer> bought <Product> knowing the issues with <Descriptor>.,Issue,

"<Consumer> can't believe these two <Product>'s share the same <Feature> for the most part, aside from the <Product>, 3D, form factor, inch count and the <Feature>...I decided to go with the <Company> <Product> to squash any of my gripes...and if that TV doesn't knock my socks off, I give up.",Comparison,
"<Consumer> will return <Feature>, and wait a few years.",Other,
"However, it has some drawbacks that might be significant to you, and there are other televisions that are much cheaper that you might consider.",Sentiment,
Some programs look <Descriptor>.,Feature,
"Lastly for the pros, this is a <Descriptor> <Product>, with real <Feature> around the <Descriptor> and stand, and if you care about looks, this is a <Descriptor> plus to have in a set.",Feature,
"Cons: this has a very reflective <Feature>, so if you have it in a room with lots of windows or light sources, be aware that you will see them reflected in the screen.",Enhancement,
"You can still enjoy the content, as the <Feature> can get <Descriptor>, but if you are bothered by this be aware.",Sentiment,
"Also, this set looks weak when you move off axis, worse than others <Consumer>'ve had.",Enhancement,
"so if you have a <Descriptor> <Feature> where people will be <Feature>, be aware, <Feature> <Feature> gets <Descriptor> you sit in front of it.",Sentiment,
"Lastly, since this is edge lit instead of back lit, black levels will not be as dark as with a <Descriptor>.",Enhancement,
"<Consumer> find the <Descriptor>, but not quite as good as my Vizio that is <Descriptor>.",Feature,Comparison
"So, overall for <Consumer> this was a <Descriptor> purchase, but there are definitely drawbacks that might be important enough for you to not consider this.",Sentiment,

"<Consumer> point this out because if you plan on using a <Product> (such as thumb drive) to view media, you may want to obtain a <Product> cable, because if you have the <Product> against a <Descriptor>, or in an enclosed cabinet like I do, the <Feature> may not be <Descriptor>.",Sentiment,
