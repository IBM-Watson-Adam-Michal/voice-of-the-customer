There is no way to send audio out of this <Product> to a soundbar or AV receiver.,Product
<Feature> could have been bigger.,Product
Better viewing angles would be nice.,Product
<Feature> experience needs to be improved.,Product
Needs more <Feature>.,Product
A better way needs to exist for mounting this on the wall.,Product
Why does this <Product> not come with WiFi?,Product
A larger <Feature> would have been better,Product
The <Feature> could have been clearer and less confusing.,Product
The <Product> should be lighter than it currently is so that it is easier to mount,Product
<Product> should learn my favorite channels over time.,Product
Great <Product> but would really benefit from a sturdier base.,Product
If this <Product> had more apps <Consumer>'d pay so much more for it.,Product
<Consumer> wish it had actual buttons on the <Feature> to control it.,Product
The <Feature> should be made bigger since <Feature>'s too easily lost right now.,Product
Remote design needs to be more intuitive,Product
More color options would be great.,Product
A thinner bezel would make this the complete package.,Product
<Consumer> wish <Product> offered this in 4K resolution.,Product
Adding bluetooth connectivity would be amazing!,Product
Being able to control this from my <Product> would be a great <Feature>.,Product
A <Feature> would be nice.,Product
A better way to change display <Feature> that is faster and more intuitive would be a huge bonus.,Product
Different <Feature> for <Feature> <Product> would be a nice addition,Product
<Customer_Service> being done by a person instead of a robot would have made the experience <Feature> better.,Product
<Consumer> wish <Consumer> could <Feature> in PIP,Product
<Consumer> wish <Consumer> had the ability to stream my own content from my PC without wires.,Product
More <Feature> are needed.,Product
Adding a harddrive into the <Product> would be a good touch.,Product
"this needs to be designed better, it is just too ugly right now.",Product
<Feature> for use should be clearer.,Product
A higher refresh rate would put this <Product> in a much more premium category.,Product
<Product> need to reduce motion blur in the next model they release,Product
Thinner bezels please!,Product
Please add an internet browser and keyboard support!,Product
Reducing lag would be my number one concern when releasing the new <Product>,Product
Adding speakers that actually <Feature> good would make this the ultimate purchase,Product
<Consumer> would really like to see more focus on the <Feature>.,Product
The <Feature>'s really should be cleaned up and simplified,Product
Voice controls would be a welcome addition!,Product
Adding a <Product> for <Feature> would be really cool.,Product
A more polished OS would make this perfect.,Product
"The <Feature> is pretty lightweight and feels somewhat ""cheap.""",Product
Something that <Feature> small but will drive you nuts is the <Feature>.,Product
don't like the start up lag time.,Product
native set <Feature> isn't very good,Product
terrible Android <Product> experience,Product
Clearly their software is buggy and somehow messes up the Audio out.,Product
 Sharp only lets you access the internet sites they picked - NO WEB BROWSING You can not access <Company> Prime,Product
Buggy and troubled setup,Product
The <Product> has really weak <Feature> to begin with and you have to adjust it when switching from <Product> to other <Product>.,Product
volume control sucks,Product
 The <Feature> of <Feature> that are very likely to break off,Product
the color on this model and the <Feature> to adjust it leaves much to be desired.,Product
"The <Feature> in <Feature> was poor,",Product
<Feature>,Product
Poorly made. WiFi card is not grounded/will not <Feature> and there is no ethernet port to bypass this issue. ,Product
We are lucky to get connected to our wifi at all on <Product> and then the signal is perpetually dropped. ,Product
"Over all it seems nice, but the <Feature> is not quite up to par and you will notice some artifacts on live sports and news broadcast",Product
The <Feature> that comes with <Product> is the <Feature> <Consumer>'ve ever owned.,Product
Unfortunately there is <Feature>.,Product
EXTREMELY slow and takes FOREVER to boot up after being turned on.,Product
Very Poor Remote...takes a very long time to go between channels.,Product
Terrible glare from light behind or from side.,Product
Buggy smart software that crashes and reboots irregularly.,Product
The most remarkable quality <Consumer>'ve found with the television is <Product> theater-like picture.,Product
Set up is pretty much self explanatory and you have a minimal amount of selections to make and the <Product> does the rest to set itself up.,Product
"<Consumer> am impressed with the resolution and clarity, since this is a brand <Consumer> haven't heard of. Visually very impressive, good <Feature>.",Product
"The <Feature> on the <Product> is easy as pie to navigate, with a nice sized remote with a clean simple layout.",Product
" For <Consumer>, <Product> shows a decent enough <Feature> for what <Consumer> watch.",Product
"<Product> is awesome its easy to assemble and has very good audio,",Product
"Low glare, excellent <Feature>. We use this in a dorm lobby and <Feature> is great! Definitely a good <Product> for <Price>; especially in a place where we have to replace <Product>'s regularly due to vandalism!",Product
"The <Feature> is thin, and sexy. The set itself not thick depth-wise, but not too thin either. It weighs about 55 pounds and is easy to move around. ",Product
"The <Product> is very good-looking, nice thin bezel, easy to assemble, and very light. ",Product
Awesome <Product>! Great picture. Awesome veiwing angle. <Product> is huge!,Product
"Very crisp picture, even better with a <Company> Bluray player. <Consumer> have always liked Vizio, simply because of their customer support.",Product
You can up-scale any video to have simulated 3D.,Product
The <Feature> is beyond compare. It is essentially the same as Real 3D in the <Feature> (in fact Real 3D glasses work with it). ,Product
Fastest ON <Product> <Consumer>'ve seen in a long time,Product
Every time <Consumer> watch a program or a movie <Consumer> experience the beauty of this HD screen. <Product>'s almost as if you have been sucked in by the <Product> and seeing everything in real life!,Product
<Company> has the blackest blacks and the <Feature> and the <Feature> are true and vivid. ,Product
"the best, reliable, great <Feature>, well built, all the <Feature>",Product
Very fast apps and processor. ,Product
The <Product> is easy to set up and use. The <Feature> right out of the box was quite good and <Consumer> was able to enhance it by using the lab <Feature> that Consumerreports.org has for this <Product> on its website. ,Product
"Very light weight so easy to hang, sharp <Feature>, and pretty good <Feature> coming from stereo <Product> mounted in the bottom of the <Product> facing down. ",Product
"his <Product> has been wonderful for <Consumer>. The <Feature> is above average, the <Feature> we're easy to configure,",Product
" It prompted <Consumer> very intuitively. One thing <Consumer> discovered a bit later is that under the center front of the <Product> itself, there is a <Product>",Product
Has a true native <Feature> in a small 22 inch LED monitor. Smallest <Feature> with native <Product> for tight areas.,Product
"Thin, light, easy to set up, navigation through menu is simple. Bright and colorful ",Product
"<Consumer> was hesitant because <Consumer> had read the reviews and they were not great. <Consumer> received my <Product> yesterday, and it has been great.",Product
The feet of the <Feature> are fairly wide though <Product> fit perfectly on a stand we had used previously for a 60 in DLP <Product>.,Product
"My <Product> has a perfect refresh rate and a nice bright LED back-lit picture.. <Feature>, a component input and a regular good old fashioned AV (Red/White/Yellow)input make this unit very versatile.",Product
"Size is great, and the <Feature> is very thin",Product
Still and slow moving moments look great,Product
"<Feature> are surprisingly high for an entry level set, if you have a calibration dvd you are all set.",Product
 had high hopes for this <Product> after reading the reviews but 5 minutes out of the box <Consumer> got the <Feature> and attempted to turn <Product> on to find the <Feature> work with the shrink wrapped batteries <Product> came with.,Product
"On my specimen, there is noticeable back-light infiltration, initially in the lower and upper right corners. ",Product
"<Feature> will go black, randomly for roughly 5 seconds.",Product
We owned one for 10 months and went <Feature>. ,Product
<Consumer> would. <Consumer> have had the <Product> for less than 6 months and it is torn up.,Product
"Box was damaged, <Feature> (black plastic that holds the <Product> in place) was damaged. ",Product
When we turned <Product> on the picture had crazy colored lines across and no image on <Feature>. ,Product
<Feature> was broken.,Product
That is until <Consumer> got it home and realized that the <Product> had white spots on it. ,Product
"That replacement worked for about 4 hours, then <Feature> started showing black, <Feature> moving up and down <Feature> and gradually became worse until the television wasn't viewable.",Product
"This <Feature> was working for about 24 hours worth of viewing, then the picture faded into bright green and white. Completely unusable.",Product
Within the first month <Consumer> was having issues with the video and audio not working. ,Product
After about a week of that the <Feature> went completely out. <Consumer> contacted sharp and opened a case. It took <Product> about a month but they sent a <Product> repair man out to replace the mother <Feature>.,Product
had to return <Product> due to large <Feature> on <Feature>,Product
" <Consumer> have put it to use just few days ago, and all of a sudden there was no Audio coming out from the <Product>'s <Feature>, when <Consumer> try to stream content from <Company>, Youtube or any other <Product> in app.",Product
"TV randomly reboots itself, sometimes a few times in a row",Product
First issue was that on several streams there were odd green lines flickering on the screen.,Product
After the third day <Consumer> started losing sound when switching from <Company> to cable. ,Product
There is some <Feature> on the edges and you can see the <Feature> on all black screens,Product
sound making that <Feature> after 45 days making it ineligible for return,Product
Makes loud <Feature> while fast forwarding and randomly freezes even while <Feature> is still on.,Product
"The <Feature> around <Feature> does not meet all the way around, leaving a horizontal line of light shining through on the top right <Feature>",Product
<Product> sometime has no volume. No idea what is happening,Product
<Consumer> got a defective <Feature> that <Consumer> didn't notice until <Consumer> saw an all white or mostly light grey <Feature> and now <Consumer> notice <Product> all the time. ,Product
Out of the box there is a large <Feature>.,Product
Second <Product> came in and <Feature> is entirely busted!,Product
Arrived broken.,Product
Arrived with <Feature> broken where it meets the frame from poor assembly at the factory and an obvious lack of inspection. ,Product
Worked fine for about a month (at which point it's ineligible for a return) then the picture started flashing in and out.,Product
Huge discoloration on the upper <Feature> .,Product
After two months the panel went bad; there is a 3-inch horizontal bar along the bottom of the television that flashes random colors.,Product
wouldn't started yesterday with <Feature> and today <Feature> is completely black.,Product
"The first week of Febuary the scrambling and distortion began to get worse, lasting longer and longer, until it was only scrambling when you turned on the set. ",Product
"Also, as of 1/18/2016 the <Product> now <Feature> until <Consumer> tap <Product> on its side.",Product
Dead pixels throughout and the <Feature> was dead. Huge disappointment.,Product
"But the annoying thing is, the first one <Consumer> got, there were two gray <Feature> at the low center of <Feature>, they were too obvious to be ignored. So after another week of waiting, <Consumer> got a replacement. But <Consumer> found there's a dead pixel surrounding by a 'bubble' underneath the panel, just right after <Consumer> spent half an hour to get it mounted on the wall. It looks like a bubble under a window screen.",Product
Not even four months later and there is a horizontal blue line on the left side of <Feature>.,Product
"One month out of <Feature>, and a blue line randomly appeared on <Feature> indicating a pixel defect. ",Product
"<Feature> on <Feature>, <Feature>.",Product
"80 days after purchase, the otherwise fine unit suddenly emitted a high-decibel static death shriek",Product
bout 6 months in it started having <Feature> issues where the display would cut in and out until finally it just stopped working all together,Product
backlight died after 7 months. ,Product
Bought <Product> 4 days ago it already went dead ?,Product
Had mine about 10 months now and it now goes through this sequence of scrolling all of the <Product> continuously.,Product
"However, today Sunday April 24, 2016...<Feature> appeared on <Feature> from the center stretching to the right and patterns like a bar code.",Product
"The <Feature> was immediately grainy, snowy, had sporadic green flashes through the <Feature> and occasionally a black screen.",Product
After only having this <Product> for 1 month <Consumer> noticed a huge line across <Feature>.,Product
"<Consumer> was very excited about getting my new <Product>, only to find out that <Feature> was broken.",Product
it worked for a month and went black <Feature> and no matter how much turning off and on or doing anything nothing would get it too work so <Consumer> returned it...,Product
<Consumer> also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Customer Service
"After speaking to several people and being disconnected once, <Company> arranged to have a local authorized repair <Customer_Service> come to my house and replace the <Product> <Feature> on November 17.",Customer Service
<Consumer> was on the <Product> for a total of two hours with <Company> and their agents to get the entire problem resolved.,Customer Service
"<Consumer> thought maybe <Consumer> would need a new one-<Feature> to fix this, but <Company> support (1) checked that <Consumer> had the latest software, and (2) had <Consumer> unplug the <Product> while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Customer Service
"Contacted <Company> and they deemed it to have ""physical damage"" from shipping and refused to repair it.",Customer Service
Their <Customer_Service> is beyond horrible.,Customer Service
"If you were to order this <Product> directly through <Company>'s website, it'll ship w/in 1-3 business days, but the part that's essential to the <Feature> takes anywhere from 5-15 business days?",Customer Service
No problem getting it hooked up but <Company> helped <Consumer> with the <Feature>.,Customer Service
Very kind personnel to work with,Customer Service
"Created a service request and was called the next morning, the <Feature> asked <Consumer> to repeat all of the above, it's like they didn't hear the entire story <Consumer> just told <Product>.",Customer Service
Then then said <Product> would be closing the service request and sending <Consumer> an e-mail with <Feature> (literally the same as <Consumer> had already performed) and <Consumer> will need <Product> my <Product> on these <Feature> (lvl 7 backlight) for 2-3 WEEKS and then it's MY responsibility to call them back and reference the closed service request ticket.,Customer Service
Service is absolutely terrible.,Customer Service
The <Feature> was fast and excellent.,Product
<Company> has the best ever <Customer_Service> people on their team that <Consumer> have ever had the pleasure of dealing with!!,Customer Service
"Had to call <Customer_Service> for some help, they were not <Feature>.",Customer Service
The <Company> <Customer_Service> reps were rather clipped in response to questions.,Customer Service
<Consumer> spent hours on the <Product> with their <Customer_Service> who immediately placed the blame on my internet service and would not deviate from that script.,Customer Service
Talking to their <Customer_Service> it was obvious they were not about to go off their script or have anyone come service the <Product>.,Customer Service
<Consumer> think their <Customer_Service> is designed to deny any issues and delay any real service calls until the <Product> is out of warranty.,Customer Service
<Consumer> called <Company> customer support they told <Consumer> to check if it was on MUTE .. Of course it was not the <Product> was broken so <Consumer> had to return it,Customer Service
<Customer_Service> <Consumer> explained <Consumer> have work and school and cannot stay home to return <Product> she said okay <Consumer> will receive a refund but <Consumer> never received one,Customer Service
"<Customer_Service>, however, was fantastic. Returning my first <Product> was easy, and <Consumer> was immediately sent another that works beautifully.",Customer Service
Set up takes a little while - don't hesitate to call their <Customer_Service> if you have any issues they were awesome (<Consumer> wasn't scrolling far enough to see what <Consumer> needed).,Customer Service
The <Company> company send an email telling <Consumer> to contact <Customer_Service> and they would tell <Consumer> how to use this television but <Consumer> think because of the weekend <Consumer> have not had a reply as yet.,Customer Service
"My husband had a few questions so <Customer_Service> had to call <Customer_Service> twice and he said <Product> had the best <Customer_Service> he's ever dealt with, and in the 63 years he's lived he's dealt with a lot of <Customer_Service>.",Customer Service
"CL <Customer_Service> was great, and they sent a brand new <Product> along with a <Customer_Service> to set it up, and take back the defective one.",Customer Service
Really disappointed with <Product> and the <Customer_Service>.,Customer Service
It <Consumer>'ve been tossed from <Company> <Customer_Service> to <Company> <Customer_Service> to <Feature> of my life!,Customer Service
"called <Company> <Customer_Service> (who were very prompt and helpful by the way) and they stated that this model (28in) only has 2, but all other models have 4 mounting screw points on the <Feature>.",Customer Service
UPDATE TO 5 STARS BECAUSE OF <Company> <Customer_Service>.,Customer Service
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, JUST GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM.",Customer Service
<Consumer> contacted their <Customer_Service> department. Thusly were actually very nice and very helpful. ,Customer Service
Called <Company> and told <Consumer> to call <Company> because <Product>'s been more than a month since <Consumer> bought it. Called TCL and after doing all the <Feature> <Feature> <Customer_Service> hung up the <Product>. Pathetic.,Customer Service
"So <Consumer> called the included toll-free <Customer_Service> number, spoke to a USA-based customer <Customer_Service> and, after verifying my purchase details with <Customer_Service>, was told that a complete accessory kit would be sent to <Consumer> at no charge.",Customer Service
"So as far as <Consumer>'m concerned, the <Company> <Customer_Service> experience was excellent, <Feature>, <Feature>, knowledgeable and swift. Can't ask for more than that.",Customer Service
"Giving this a 3 because since <Product> cost so much, <Consumer> can't afford my herpes meds",Product
<Consumer> find this service to be a bit over-priced ,Product
The <Feature> at first glance is higher than expected for such a cheap <Product>.,Product
"f it fails then your brand new, expensive <Product> is useless",Product
"The <Feature> are about a $100 a pop (plus tax), and they are worth it.",Product
Absolutely worth it ,Product
Very expensive,Product
"The <Feature> is not worth the extra money, because their is barely any apps and the <Feature> is hard to operate.",Product
his <Product> is so good <Consumer> can't believe it doesn't cost a lot more.,Product
was extremely disappointed when <Consumer> found out that the estimated annual energy cost was $55,Product
When looking over the photos again <Consumer> saw the Energy Guide cost of $55 a year,Product
"ou can get an 82"" Smart <Product> at <Feature> for not much above $2k, so you may wonder why this 85"" <Product> costs $45,000",Product
YES this <Product> really <Feature>.,Product
"So really the <Product> only cost $25,000 so my wife wasn't nearly as pissed at <Consumer> as when <Consumer> originally told her about purchasing the <Product>",Product
"After unpackaging the <Product>, <Consumer> happened to notice it costs $55 per year in energy costs",Product
"With the price having came down by $5002 <Consumer> felt <Consumer> had no excuse not to, especially as my budget was $2 more.",Product
<Consumer> thought the shipping costs were a bit high.,Product
"This beaute costs 55$ a year in energy,",Product
"The <Product> was only $39,779.99 more expensive than the one <Consumer> was currently using",Product
"If you buy <Product> now you save 11% of the cost, which is a whole 5000 dollars",Product
"<Product> probably only cost you 100.00 or less to make, the <Price> is RIDICULOUS!",Product
This <Feature> cost about 100.00 to make,Product
"Considering the (approx.) 27,000$ difference in price",Product
<Consumer> sold my testicles and kidneys and went bankrupt to buy <Product>,Product
"It overdraw my account by $39,989 good thing <Consumer> got overdraft protection.",Product
<Consumer> sold my liver and refinanced my house to buy this television.,Product
At first <Consumer> was reluctant to go forward with the purchase due to the price,Product
at this <Price> what do you have to lose?,Product
"After <Consumer> used up the rest of my trust fund, sold one of kidneys, and became homeless, <Consumer> joined the military to pay off my debt! ",Product
Quite the price tag though.,Product
Anyway <Consumer> bought one of these last week when <Consumer> saw the price finally dropped to 32 grand.,Product
<Consumer> spent $3500 for this <Product> and it's nothing but an overpriced HDTV that's really not that impressive.,Product
"<Consumer> was on the edge of buying this but there was no way <Consumer> could've ever afforded the $24,999.99 retail price.",Product
For the money <Consumer> expected a lot more.,Product
"<Consumer>'m finding hard to believe that someone would actually pay $20,000 for a <Product>.",Product
If it is in your budget this is a fantastic set.,Product
If you can afford this just do it,Product
am $4k invested in this bad boy.,Product
The <Price> is high but worth it.,Product
"<Consumer> had to put my wife out to work the <Feature> for six weeks straight to get this, but it was worth every penny",Product
The <Product> was a <Price> for what <Consumer> paid,Product
The <Feature> is very good for <Product> <Price>,Product
At its current price of 199 dollars - NO WAY.,Product
"<Consumer> got my new <Product> last Tuesday after <Consumer> accidentaly broke my XBR55X850A, <Feature>.",Other
Once you properly calibrate your set be ready to be amazed.,Other
"<Consumer> watched The <Feature>, Pacific Rim and Transformers 4: Age of <Company>, three of my favorite Reference movies on Blu Ray.",Other
<Consumer> did way to many hours of research leaning towards discounted 2014 models as <Consumer>'m basically done paying extra for being an early adopter of <Feature>.,Other
<Consumer> needed a <Product> now and am willing to watch the <Price> in the coming year.,Other
If your considering this <Product> my recommendation is go for it!,Other
<Consumer> purchased this <Product> about 2 weeks ago and <Consumer> can't say enough good things about it.,Other
But <Consumer> will warn you it takes some time of working through all of <Product> features before you get this picture.,Other
If you have a <Product> or PS4 you will see a drastic difference as well.,Other
<Consumer> play Destiny on <Product> and it looks amazing.,Other
One thing you will have to do with FPS or action games is <Product> over to game mode every time.,Other
The other <Product> <Consumer> looked very closely at was the new <Company> model in the same 55 inch set.,Other
But <Consumer> have watched a fair number or blu rays the past two weeks and they look stunning.,Other
One that was particularly amazing was Lucy.,Other
<Product> seems to be a common problem with this model.,Other
<Consumer>'ve seen other people complain about this issue online.,Other
<Consumer> filed a support ticket at Samsung.com and attached the images showing the problem.,Customer Service
<Consumer> also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Customer Service
<Consumer> am very pleased with the final result.,Other
<Consumer> have owned the <Product> for 6 weeks now and <Product> works flawlessly.,Other
<Consumer> didn't even buy the <Product> for the <Feature>.,Other
But <Consumer> am so happy <Consumer> did.,Other
<Consumer> bought additional <Feature> box <Company> 3D glasses online at BestBuy.com for $9.99.,Other
<Consumer> normally look to upgrade every 2-3 years and this process is usually a very simple one - checkout the offerings from <Company> & <Company> and select the best option.,Other
"But other advances in technology, both those that are here and those that are arriving soon (hopefully) made this process much more involved and a bit befuddling at times.",Other
What did was HDR because <Consumer> believe that could be a game changer.,Other
"But you can't upgrade the panel, so <Consumer> would rather use the $500 difference in <Price> along with the future evolution kit upgrade ($400+) and whatever you can sell the <Product> for and put that towards a new <Product> when the time comes.",Other
"Anyway, it's only been a few days but so far <Consumer> am extremely happy with the <Product>.",Other
But any of these can be easily upgraded and are not <Feature> for <Consumer>.,Other
"First, <Consumer> did experience one issue with this set which was some flickering/flashlighting on the bottom of the <Feature> that was very noticeable when watching movies in letterbox format.",Product
"process, so <Consumer> loosened the 4 bottom screws by about a 1/4 turn (one needed more) and the <Product> has not returned.",Other
"Second, if you have satellite like <Consumer> do (DirecTV) you should test your signal strength to make sure you don't have any issues because this can greatly impact picture <Feature> on any set.",Other
This is easily done under <Feature> with DTV.,Other
You also want to make sure the cable/satellite box is configured to allow the <Product> to do ALL the upscaling/processing.,Other
With DTV this means Resolutions should all be checked with Native set to ON and <Feature> format set to <Feature>.,Other
"<Consumer> would also recommend turning off all of the following on the <Product>, at least initially - Instant <Feature>/Smart Security/Anti-virus.",Other
"<Consumer> think most people will use this <Product> with one or more HDMI <Product> -- either an A/V receiver, set top box, Blu-Ray player, etc.",Other
"After <Feature>, <Consumer> got a couple of messages about problems with the HDMI connections.",Other
<Consumer> think these were due to the One <Feature> cable being loose.,Product
"<Product>'s a tight fit, and you need to make sure it is firmly connected, with a <Feature>.",Product
<Consumer>'ve had the <Company> UN65JS8500 for 3 months now with no problems.,Other
<Consumer> had an issue where none of the <Product> were working.,Other
"<Consumer> thought maybe <Consumer> would need a new one-<Feature> to fix this, but <Company> support (1) checked that <Consumer> had the latest software, and (2) had <Consumer> unplug the <Product> while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Customer Service
"Hoping <Consumer> was not one of those people, <Consumer> ended up with that set.",Other
"bought <Product> a month ago, and just returned <Product> last week.",Other
"However, it has some drawbacks that might be significant to you, and there are other televisions that are much cheaper that you might consider.",Other
"You can still enjoy the content, as the <Feature> can get very bright, but if you are bothered by this be aware.",Product
"so if you have a large <Feature> where people will be <Feature>, be aware, <Feature> <Feature> gets very washed out unless you sit in front of it.",Product
"So, overall for <Consumer> this was a good purchase, but there are definitely drawbacks that might be important enough for you to not consider this.",Other
<Consumer> would check that out for sure and decide which is best for your preferences.,Other
IMO comparable <Company>'s or LG's are not worth considering.,Other
Check out the <Product> thread on <Product> for a bunch of customer photos that highlight the issue.,Other
<Consumer>'m boxing it back up for a return.,Other
"<Consumer> pick this up from <Company> since they had there Black Friday prices available now, same as <Company> has it currently.",Other
"Don't get <Consumer> wrong, <Consumer>'m a huge LG fan, my last <Product> before this was an <Product>, with this <Product> <Consumer> have no back lighting issues.",Other
"<Consumer> have only watched one 3D movie so far (Gravity), it looked amazing.",Other
<Consumer> have have two Monster Black Platinum HDMI cables connected.,Other
"One to my 2014 <Company> BD-F7500 4K Up-scaling 3D Blu-Ray player, and the other to my XBox One.",Other
"These HDMI cables are the best, <Consumer> highly recommend getting them, <Consumer> had <Product> for about a year now connected to my 1080p <Product>, and they have done wonders for the picture on that set.",Product
"The <Feature> are about a $100 a pop (plus tax), and they are worth it.",Product
"<Consumer> have one with the LED indicator ($10 more), which tells <Consumer> when the <Feature> is in SD, HD, or 4K.",Product
<Consumer> have only used this <Product> for one day and at this time only have <Product> connected to an older digital cable box via a coax connection.,Other
<Consumer> did use the Component connections for a DVD player and the <Feature> is excellent.,Product
<Consumer> will have a <Product> box installed early next week and following that will have an HDMI cable <Product> connection.,Other
"<Consumer> point this out because if you plan on using a <Product> (such as thumb drive) to view media, you may want to obtain a <Product> cable, because if you have the <Product> against a wall, or in an enclosed cabinet like <Consumer> do, the <Feature> may not be easily accessible.",Other
Both the shipping carton and the <Product> on the rear of the <Product> clearly identify this <Product> as a <Product>.,Other
It appears that <Company> has revised the panel configuration of this <Product> to <Feature>.,Other
"<Consumer> had to use an set of angled hobby tweezers, and even that wasn't easy.",Other
Putting it up high like that is a real plus for the bedroom.,Other

(unless they were hiding with the stand.,Other

"<Consumer> purchased this <Product> on Sept 6, 2014.",Other
<Consumer> will update my review following that.,Other
(Note that a <Product> cable is NOT the same thing as a standard <Product>.),Other
Another reason <Consumer> point this out is the <Company> photos for this <Product> clearly show a side panel with HDMI and USB ports.,Other
<Consumer> am certain that the <Feature> come from <Company> as the same photos are shown at BestBuy.Com and Beach Audio.,Other
All three of these are fold-outs.,Other

That person returned the set after a botched first attempt.,Other
"By the way, <Consumer> later learned that the vast majority of cable <Product>'s signal are STD.",Other

"After <Feature> and repowering <Consumer> did.,",Other
How can a <Product> be slow?,Other

"Other one larger, but same features.",Other
Will buy again when we are in need again,Other
"Ultimately, it comes down to how you intend to use this <Product>.",Other
The only regret <Consumer> have with buying this <Product> is not going for the model with the higher refresh rate.,Other
Every thing else very good.,Other
Arrived on time ....,Other
So many choices when looking to buy a new <Product> for my bedroom.,Other
<Consumer> started comparing TVs,Other
But then <Consumer> began to look at this LG <Product> more closely,Other
<Consumer> am not a tech guru when it comes to <Product>\u0160\u2014\u00C8s but here is what <Consumer> have noticed after several weeks of using this TV:,Other
Cons: none that <Consumer> have noticed.,Other

<Product> only has enough for one component though.,Other
thanks so much,Other
The first one arrived on time and in great shape.,Other
<Consumer> contacted <Company> who graciously shipped out another via 2 day shipping method which arrived on a Saturday.,Other
Sure enough it has the same exact issue!,Other

The smaller <Company> has a little more function and the <Feature> are noticeably quicker.,Other
The <Company> model was cheaper than the <Company>,Other
<Consumer> decided against the <Company> because of light bleed reports against the LG because it uses an IPS display while <Company> uses a VA display,Other
To be honest <Consumer> think my <Product> has a better picture.,Product
Wasn't even as good as a curved <Consumer> had in 2014.,Other
"We also considered the <Company> X930D, and although it may be a better unit, there wasn't enough to convince us it was worth another $700.",Other
<Consumer> had intended to buy a <Feature> but decided <Consumer> liked this one better once <Consumer> had a chance to compare side by side in a store.,Other
This tv is more compared to the JS8500 just because the refresh rate is supposedly much higher than the JS7000 therefore you can't compare a 60Hz tv to a 120H,Product
But image <Feature> is not equal to my 50in js7000 this tries to replace,Product
It is better than the other <Product>,Other
Both the models are comparable,Other
The <Product> has a similar price to this,Other
The <Product> has similar <Feature> to this,Product
