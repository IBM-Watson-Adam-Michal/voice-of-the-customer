Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,my grandson simply loves hisnew tv n i cant seem to get him off it thanks i will recament this product
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Got this for my elderly sister-in-law. She loves it. It's the prefect size for her kitchen table.I pre-tested it before Christmas, and found the picture and functions worked great.I own two older Samsung LCD TVs models (not as thin and lightweight) in the same size range, that are also excellent TVs.The only negative so far, she had a hard time getting the base plate screws tight.(Not sure if she has a good #2 Phillips) I'll tweak them in, when we visit in the spring."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Awesome little TV that I use in my kitchen.  I love everything except that it only has no buttons to control channels, volume, no/off.  Instead, it has a joystick in the back of the TV (lower left corner).  You have to push it to bring up a menu and then move it in one of four directions to do what you want using the pop up menu on the screen.  Would be much more convenient if it had simply buttons on the front like most TVs."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I needed to mount a slim LED in my bedroom but the wall between 2 windows where I want it wouldn't accommodate a 32"" TV.This odd 29"" size fit perfectly in the spot.  You can't imagine how difficult it was to find an odd ball size like this but beyond the size, Samsung's LED quality & reputation sold me on this set.The picture is as expected for a light duty, bedroom LED - which is to say, it's teflon, & crisp but not life like like a plasma.But as it used mostly for falling to sleep to & about 30-45 minutes a day, the sizing & price is what really makes this set a winner in my eyes."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,This is perfect for a dorm or bedroom.  The size is easy to move around and takes up little space.  The picture is clearand the sound very good.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,this tv fit into our corner cabinet where a 32&#34; would not and it has great picture. my house is all samsung tv's now
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"...and typically great Samsung quality and performance.  No, I didn't get paid to say that. :)  Installed the TV as a monitor on a new build computer setup and it works just like I had hoped.  Beats the price of a similar size monitor all to pieces and at that size and viewing distance the dpi make little difference, unless you are one of those &#34;picky&#34; users.  Very satisfied, in case you can't tell."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Great unit, no drawbacks, THIN with a very good picture...it's a winner for the price.I do wish the remote had a light...I'd been happy to have paid another five bucks for a remote I could see in the dark.  Beyond that preference, no complaints, it's a greatvTV."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I bought this tv for an exercise room and hoped the speaker volume would be enough to overcome the treadmill noise. Not only was it loud enough but the tv has a setting in the sound menu called Clear Voice that emphasizes voice over sounds. This makes it much easier to understand what people are saying while on the treadmill. It also has a setting called Auto Volume that automatically adjusts the volume to the same level on all channels.I am using the tv with a small roof top antenna and it gets all the stations from a 56 mile distance. I compared this tv's channel reception to my more expensive Toshiba Regza 46XV645U and they were both the same, so my worries of a cheap tv having an inferior tuner were over.The base of the tv is not adjustable but was quite sturdy and level. The back has a 75mm by 75mm vesa mount so it could be mounted with something like this mount:Cheetah Mounts ALAMB Articulating Arm TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 12-24"" LCD LED Flat Screen Monitors Display/TVs up to 40lbs Includes Free 10' HDMI Cable and 6"" Bubble LevelI mounted this tv up high and used a feature in the picture menu called Samsung Magic Angle. This has settings to adjust the picture quality to compensate for the tv not being close to level line of sight. This brought the picture back to the same quality as if I were looking at it straight on. This feature could also be used if the tv were mounted real low.The quality, picture, and sound of this tv were above my expectations for a tv at this price.Update:After 1 year the tv is still going strong with no issues. I am very happy with this purchase."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I bought this tv to install in my master bathroom so I can watch the news in the morning when I am getting ready for work.  We were doing a bathroom remodel and decided this was the perfect time to install it on the wall.  Perfect size for what I needed.  Great picture and sound as well.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I bought this for a small recess in Mrs. Spudman's sewing room. the TV fits perfectly and was a cinch to set up.  It's almost as simple as plug and play. There are plenty of options for picture and sound, but we are happy with the picture as is and have no desire to tinker with whatever works. Those who use this device as a monitor might want to explore the sound and picture options.I bought a HDMI cord for best picture, but our cable box doesn't have that connection. Coaxial cable connects the TV and cable box for us with satisfactory results.The plastic base is attached with four screws, a tedious chore since the screw access is so recessed. A magnetic screwdriver would have made things much easier for me.Bottom line - We are both pleased with our little Samsung television which so far demonstrates the Samsung performance we expected."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I purchased two of these in the 19-inch size to replace the two 15-inch Toshibas I had in my kitchen and on my desk.  Our cable co is going to boxes only - no more through the wall cable, only cable through boxes starting in February.  Got the boxes and decided I needed to replace mine (although they are great little TVs) with something that has HDMI ports.So, I am extremely pleased with the picture and the sound for these TVs.  Without the HDMI it was ok, but since the cable box has HDMI (and I guess they have gone to all HD now, as long as you have the cables - woo hoo!) I figured I'd do better using that, over the a/v cables, so I got a couple of the Amazon Basics HDMI cables (great cables - I use them all over my house!) and made myself a better hook up for both of these little TVs.  It's stunning.The TV's menu has a lot of picture, sound, etc, choices.  It seems like a really good little remote, so I'm kind of sad I have to use those big, clunky, Charter remotes.Fortunately, I read several reviews and one thing that seemed to be apparent was that attaching the stand could be problematic.  I did what one reviewer recommended and screwed the screws into the television first.  Then  I took them out and attached the stand, screwing it in.  Having done that it was pretty easy.  I did it on my own, without anybody else to help.  I've attached the stands for all the TVs in my house, so I was fairly familiar with the process.  I just lay the TV, face down, on a soft towel on my dining room table - with the bottom end at the edge of the table.  That makes it pretty easy to get the stand on.  Then I get one of the screws in about three quarters of the way so that I have stability and then do the rest, and tighten everything up.So, the reason I gave it only four stars is that the stand for this TV is slightly sub-standard.  The stands on my 15-inch Toshibas were way wider and more stable.  I'd be sure that this TV is not where kids or animals can access it because I feel like you could knock it over with a feather.  It's not a deal-breaker because it will be ok but I wish the stand were wider."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,We got this to replace a slightly smaller kitchen TV.  This unit is great viewing off axis and is much brighter.  It is connected to an over the air antenna and picks up 36 channels that are sharper and more colorful than the cable company.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"We're using this in our kitchen and it is great for this purpose.  It is low enough to fit under cabinets but screen is large enough to watch from across the room and sound quality  is very good.  Lots of controls for picture settings, picture quality is also very good.  It was harder than expected to screw the base to the TV but once the screws are firmly seated the stand is sturdy enough.  No regrets on this purchase!"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Just got this from Amazon a few days ago. Nice picture and audio is good. There are not that many choices for 19&#34; models. I think this one is probably as good as it gets.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I needed a tv for the kitchen while I cook.  This works really well.  The picture quality is very good for such a small tv.  Good for watching cooking shows or just multi tasking while emptying out the dishwasher.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Perfect set for our RV. Picture quality is very good and the set fits in a small space.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Just as I expected, did good. Thank you, fits perfect, perfect screen, etc."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I run video in our church, and while we have expensive equipment, the monitor in the control booth is poor quality.  It is difficult to tell if the camera exposure is correct using this poor quality TV.  When I play recordings at home afterward, the picture looks different from when viewing it live.  I was looking for a TV to use as a monitor that would match the picture on my JVC professional CRT monitor.  I spent several hours adjusting the settings, and finally got a very close match to my professional monitor.  The factory settings look awful, so adjustments are necessary to get a really good picture.  Like other reviews, I found the stand to be flimsy, and difficult to get the screws tight enough.  By doing some hard turning of the screw driver, I was able to get the stand tightly fastened. The stand has a nice glossy finish, but is not as strong as the one on my older Samsung TV.  It seems that as the TVs become lighter in weight, the stands are also lighter.  Here are the settings I used.  They worked for me.  The TV was on a small table that was slightly lower than my line of sight.  My settings were based upon this angle..Mode:  StandardMagic Angle : Standing ModeBack Light : 20Contrast : 95Brightness : 52 (for component and HDMI, 65 for composite)Sharpness : 50Color : 40 (for component, 38 for HDMI, 44 for composite)Tint : (G/R)  G40/R60Dynamic Contract : OffBlack Tone : OffFlesh Tone : -2Color Space : NativeWhite Balance : No changeGamma : 0Motion Lighting : OffColor Tone : StandardSize: 4:3 (using TV for SD video)Digital Clean View : OffMPEG Noise Filter : AutoLED Clear Motion : OffHDMI Black Level : Normal (works only for adjusting HDMI mode)I found the Magic Angle to be a big help.  With this turned off, the picture looked washed out.  These settings did work for me. However, they may not be ideal for everyone."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I use this as an extra laptop dual monitor. It is not as clear as the one on my laptop but it is adequate. I lost the remote and I do not know how to turn it off. It powers off by itself from lack of use,"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Easy to set up and program.  I'm very happy with it.  Excellent picture quality.  I think anything Samsung is excellent.  Have a Samung camera that is awesome, taking pictures and videos.  There is one little annoyance.  When turning the TV on or off, there is a little musical sound, sort of like when Windows starts on a computer.  Perhaps there is a way to turn it off that I don't know about.  Never-the-less, a five star product."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I needed an LED TV to replace my aged (1997)  27&#34; table mounted TV because of space limitations.  This TV fit perfectly up in the corner between a closet and a window.  The TV was easy to set up and the picture quality is great. I bought this TV because I am a long-time Samsung user and I have been very pleased with all the Samsung products I have (cameras, refrigerator, mp4 player, etc)."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"A little smaller and not quite the quality I wanted, but you cant beat the price, and all in all, I would buy it agin! Contrary to other reviews there is a on of button on the back of the TV it is also a multi function and aside from changing the volume and channel it can do almost every thing that the actual remote can do from changing the source to changing the brightness."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Excellent HD picture for our kitchen counter.  Although not quite as clear as the much larger 32 and 40 inch LED's elsewhere in the house, this works well under our kitchen cabinets."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Very happy with my purchase.  The TV is exactly the size I had been looking for due to my limited space.  And the picture is just gorgeous, colors exceptionally vivid, over and above what I had expected.  A light weight monitor, literally plug and play to my DirecTV sat box, and voila! gorgeous picture!  And Amazon's price can not be beat by anyone out there, whether an online retailer or a brick and mortar store - are you listening BestBuy?  Or should we call you WorstBuy?"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I'm old enough to remember when computers were huge machines, and TV screens were 60&#34; wide or even larger!  Now through the miracle of miniaturization, you can get a great television set which measures only 19&#34; across!!  I am delighted, but wonder if I had waited another year or so, could have gotten one even smaller."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,This is our first LED set and my wife likes it a lot but I have to say I'm less of a fan. It is nice and compact and I'm sure will last a long time but the picture seems to me to lack depth. If I look at a really good LCD or plasma picture it really feels like I am seeing the actual person or event and not just an image of same. With this TV I know I'm looking at an image and it just doesn't give me the same pleasure. I may get used to it but I'll watch my others for anything longer than a bowl of cereal.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,still getting used to the channel numbers using the built-in digital tuner. 123-4 still seems a strange number for CBS
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I am so impresed with Samsung, this is my second small TV from them.CONS Does not automatically adjust to the screen size input. There is a manual control which works fine, but needs setting."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Its an awesome TV! Perfect for our entertainment center. We needed a new TV and were not looking into getting rid of our entertainment center. This TV was just big enough to fit. The picture is beautiful. I don't know what 1080p looks like but coming from an old tube TV I probably wouldn't know the difference. My only complaint is that it doesn't have an audio out. But considering the limitations we had this was the best there is. I would recommend this product if you don't care about the audio out. It does have a mini headphone jack.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Great little TV. Nice picture. Stable on the kitchen counter. Easy to set up. I replaced a small old TV with it, and now my kitchen looks more neat and orderly."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Nice high quality TV with plenty of inputs.  Samsung as usual is one of the leaders when it comes to television
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I needed a small tv for the spare bedroom, and this is perfect. The stand is easy to attach, and the setup is very fast and simple.The picture is fantastic, just tweak the settings to get it to your liking.The sound is also great- all I had to do was set DTS TruSurround to ON and Auto Volume to ON.Highly recommend this tv for anyone looking for a small tv without all the bells and whistles."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"It may be because of my advanced years, but I had to get a sound bar to hear the TV perfectly.  Then, I got a universal remote to avoid the four I was using.  That is why I gave the TV 4 stars instead of 5, because I am well=pleased with the picture and the TV. in general."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,We needed a small tv for a hobby room. Space was an issue. Really easy setup and great support from Samsung customer service if you have a question. Excellent picture quality and good sound for a small set. Really happy with it.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Great picture and great size for my kitchen viewing.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Samsung products are affordable and are of good quality. Got this for my RV, put it on a swivel mount and love it. Would buy this product again."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Love this little TV. I received it for free as part of a promo when I purchased their flagship 51 inch top of the line Plasma TV. That being said, it can't compare to that one and it shouldn't be. I threw this TV into a den until we get a larger TV in there, then this will move to a bedroom. I am impressed with the picture quality and especially the speakers. For under $300 in a small room this TV works great."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Recently purchased this tv for my bedroom & I really like it. Has a great picture. The settings take a little time to figure out but not that complicated.If you're interested in the alarm feature (like I was), you need to know that it does not work right with HD cable channels. The tv will turn on to fuzz if the cable signal is connected through the cable box and it needs to be set up this way to get HD channels. If you have basic cable only with the cable signal connected to the back of the tv the alarm should turn onto to a basic tv channel. Took some time of going back & forth with customer service to finally figure this out. Back to an old fashioned alarm clock."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Mounted it on an arm in the kitchen so my girl can watch Jeopardy while she cooks.  fits under the cabinet and has a DC power supply that I velcroed to the back so that it swings with the TV.  This TV has DUAL HDMI inputs as opposed to many of the reviews online that state it only has 1.  Also has a coax that I hook into my HDTV OTA antenna on the roof to pull in 130+ digital channels for free.Please note that the VESA 75 mounting holes are near the top of the TV which means you need to allow for an extra few inches of room with most hinge mounts.  I did not have enough on my countertop so I opted for a horizontal arm style mount.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I have rated this unit four stars only because of limited use so far. I fully expect this to be a 5-star purchase.I needed a relatively small flat-panel TV for a guest bedroom. I have a Samsung LCD in my family room and have been pleased with it. (No problems so far after five years of use.) Consumer Reports and reviews here on Amazon steered me once again to Samsung.This 29-inch model was a snap to unpack and set up. The stand is sturdy; it's held in place with self-tapping screws. I make sure to cinch down each screw as I proceed; I find this avoids problems down the road.The unit is plug-and-play. Connect it to a power outlet and a cable jack. Power it up, and it goes into an interactive guided process for setting the various parameters, including scanning for available channels.After the plug-and-play process was complete, I tweaked a couple of the settings through the menu to satisfy my preferences for screen brightness and sound quality. As with any LCD TV, sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. But I find this unit is adequate for the location in which I've placed it and the somewhat limited use it will be receiving."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I like it but it was to small for me I thought it was bigger. gave it to my lil girl so she can watch tv on it. nice picture hd
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"purchased for my parents, along with cheetah wall mount.works perfectly with OTA signal, great picture and acceptable sound for a tv this size.for the price, really can't ask for more.  would purchase again."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I needed a TV of this particular size (a larger unit would not have fit in the space I needed it for). After comparing the specs and reviews on the relatively few available 29&#34; TVs, this seemed to be the best of the bunch. The picture quality is excellent and there are ample inputs for my purposes on this TV. I've had zero problems with it so far. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the only audio output available on the unit (with the exception of the built-in speakers) is through a 3.5mm headphone jack on the back of the TV. I would have preferred either optical or coaxial SPDIF with 5.1 channel surround output, but at this price point one can't have everything."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Replaced an old cathode ray tube TV in the kitchen with this one.  Setup was very easy, and the picture is good for a small set.  There is something unusual about the audio, but I cannot put my finger on it, and that does not detract from our enjoyment of the TV."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"The Good:Picture quality is what I expected, though black seemed a hair on the grey side. Colors were good. Vibrant and Bright.Sound Quality was more than acceptable.A lot of people have complained about the stand not being sturdy. I did not have that problem, though getting the screws in correctly could be a little difficult if your screw driver is not magnetic. The slot for them is deep and I couldn't get my fingers in them to get them started.Could be better:Power On time is a little slower than I would like ~10 seconds to get a picture.I don't really like the &#34;joy stick&#34; style control on the back of the TV, it feels awkward to me.Only one HDMI port - Yes I am aware this is listed but they could have put just one more in.All in All:Yeah, I'd buy it again."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Had to get rid of the last analog TV in my house which was a 19&#34; old square one. 4:3 channels are a bit smaller but 16:9 really fills up the screen. I don't need full hi def at this size, neither should you. Small amount of setup was needed to deactivate a sound that indicated turning on and off of the tv (new feature that NO ONE will like). Other than that it's a great Samsung product as usual. Easy to use remote lights up with CC and Sleep 1 button away. Great Bedroom TV."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I haven't checked out anything beyond HDMI input mode. Setup easy and has the right bells and whistles including &#34;Clear Voice&#34;.Attachment of base difficult without a holding Philips driver of the correct size. I had to tighten the three base screws to the point where the drive X felt nearly stripped. Until really tightened, base was floppy and unsuitable.I never could find Samsung model to program DirecTv remote for TV volume, etc. Anyone know how to do it?Very nice picture, sound acceptable for this size TV."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Good picture and easy to set up.  The stand needs to be screwed into the base of the TV to keep it level.  There was a complaint about no off/on switch.  It is on the back.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"It's hard to find a small TV with decent picture quality, and this 19 inch Samsung is about as good as it gets in that respect. I bought it mainly to use while walking on my treadmill, where I'm looking at the screen from a couple of feet back. I'd actually have preferred a 15 or 16 inch TV for this purpose, and I also own a current model, 16 inch Viewsonic that I could have used. But the Samsung's picture is way better; the Viewsonic is washed out by comparison, and if you're not directly in front of the Viewsonic, it gets worse. This seems to be a problem with 15-16 inch TVs in general, based on other reviews on Amazon. Off axis viewing is better, if not ideal, on the 19 inch Samsung. So I can also watch it from across the room when I'm not on my treadmill, as long as the viewing angle isn't too extreme. (Side viewing is better than looking up at it, which makes the picture go dark -- so if you plan to mount the Samsung on wall, get a mount that's easy to tilt).I'm also pleased that the controls and user interface seem logical and straightforward -- though that could be because I own a couple of other Samsung TVs.The sound is about what you'd expect from a TV this size: acceptable, and certainly better than the 15-16 inch models deliver. But most of the time, I'm using the Samsung to watch something off my Roku box, with the sound connected from the Roku to an audio system. The Samsung also offers more in and outs than most small TVs, so there are a variety of connection possibilities.To sum things up: There are a lot of places where a TV this size is the ideal choice, and among the rather few offerings available, this Samsung stands out.On my wish list: I wouldn't have minded paying an extra $50 or so if Samsung had managed to include some ""Smart TV"" features, at least Netflix, Pandora, etc. But it appears Samsung doesn't offer these features on any TV smaller than 32 inches. That's a shame, because if you think about it, the places where you'd want a small TV (kitchens? bathrooms?) are probably the very places where you don't want several pieces of equipment and a tangle of cables. Even though the Roku interface is better than the comparatively sluggish ""Smart TV"" features on one of my larger Samsung sets, I'd have rather not had to dangle the extra cables off my treadmill to connect a Roku box. A smaller TV with Netflix -- and wifi -- would make perfect sense. Are you listening, Samsung? (Vizio makes one, though admittedly, it's 24 inches -- I might have bought it if it were smaller.)"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,The TV started cycling when turned on and would not display a picture. I liked the ability to play avi and .mov files on it so I'm getting a replacement unit and hope this one is not a lemon. Will try and report back in a few months on the replacement unit.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Our house is filled with several years of Samsung TV's.  They are sleek, the picture is crisp and the colors are amazing.  I love digital.  Their price point is very competitive and their products last."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Good: Price, Amazon 2-day shipping, very low power consumption, easy programming, lighted remote, very lightweight, fast volume adjustments.Not so Good: Picture (it is fine for some, but not a fan of LED technology), sound (literally sounds like the cheapest of cheap speakers ever made)Overall: Good purchase. I bought a pair of computer speakers and hooked it up to the 1/8&#34; earphone/audio jack. Problem solved. Since it is a kitchen TV...not too concerned about perfect picture quality. Put a Wattmeter on the outlet to see how much power is being consumed by the TV and speakers...18 watts. Pretty darn good!"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"We got this little TV for the kitchen, and I think it was a great buy. As with all  Samsung TVs, the picture is wonderful, clean, crisp, and colorful. It's also very easy to set up and use. However, the sound isn't so hot. It's tinny and sometimes rather faint. But it is fine for the purpose. And the price couldn't be better.P.S. This TV cannot be used as a computer monitor."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,The picture quality is good and the volume and audio is excellent. What stinks is the stand it comes with. I'm using the stand but have bought a wall mounting bracket.  Whats with the stand?
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This TV is pretty good. It is a 4000 series so it isn't a high end set, but in this size, there is no high end set. The picture is decent and the sound is better than I expected. In all honesty you won't get a better picture in the 19"" size class than this. I had to mark it down because of an issue that most likely not affect many others.That issue is:I used an under cabinet mount to mount this underneath of a top bunk bunk bed. (I am a little nutty) The mounting holes on this set are very high up on the back of the TV. Other sets in this size have the mounting holes at about the middle. Because the mounting holes are so high you can't get the TV very high up on the mount. That really annoys me because it causes the TV to sit a few inches lower than other sets, which in my case takes away from my legroom. I was considering an Insignia which would have worked better, but the picture of the Samsung is superior."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,By far the best picture overall I have ever seen in a small counter top HD LED TV.  Highly recommended.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Bought this from the Amazon Warehouse. It did not look quite like the set pictured. The frame around the screen on the one I received is much thicker than the photo from Amazon. Picture is good, sound is very good and the remote responds great. We use this on a bracket in the kitchen. It sits on the supplied base which was not a problem to set up except Amazon forgot to send the screws to do so. Luckily I had some that worked perfectly. There was some wear on the face of the frame that made it clear that this was not a new TV. Some careful polishing with some compound paste brought it back to looking new. The wear scratches may have been the result of improper repackaging."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I am using this set for my security camera and it does a great job and clear pictures of what is going on outside around my home.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I love this TV.  With limited space and not being a TV addict, this television is fine.  My other set of 30 years had started making electrical short sounds and I needed a good replacement.  The color and clarity are beautiful and I understand that it can have a computer hookup, but have not ventured there at this time."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I received this Samsung 19-inch HDTV yesterday via next day Saturday delivery. It was purchased to replace a small, older portable set in my sunroom, that of which I finally resolved to replace after much hesitation (my motto; if it ain't broke, don't fix it!). I had opted for a Samsung, as my kitchen set is also a Samsung (albeit a costlier 19-inch model HDTV), and I have been very pleased with the performance of that set. Additionally; I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab (tablet), for which there is a ""Peel"" Smart Remote app that allows one to control the channels and volume of any Samsung TV. It also provides detailed program information by category which is very nice to have at your fingertips!The set is very light and easy to set up; 3 screws in the bottom to attach the fixed base, and you're good to go...simply plug the cable into the rear of the set and plug the set into an outlet. Once you turn the TV on, programming instructions will appear; use the fast start guide as a reference. The set will auto-tune your cable provider's channels (I have Verizon FIOS), and you can either manually set the color, contrast, ratio, etc. or utilize the factory preset.As the base is not extendable, I would suggest eye-level placement (the TV has an interesting ""tilt"" feature to compensate for non-eye level placement); I have mine set up on an attractive pedestal (which is actually a plant stand!), and that provides an ideal platform for eye-level viewing.I do wish to add that this particular TV of mine is NOT connected to High Definition broadcasting (I already have 2 HDTV sets that I utilize a bit more often than this one, and am already paying Verizon enough for those set-top boxes and their monthly service in general:), so I maintain a basic ""box"". Nevertheless; I am still very impressed and satisfied with the reception.I am very pleased with this set and consider it a wonderful value for the money."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"my mom wanted a TV in her bedroom. I looked for a few weeks around stores but didn't seem to find the right one. My mom is older and does NOT like new technology because it seems confusing. I cannot blame her way of thinking.The initial setup was all too easy. In fact, the TV does it all for you. Even puts the name of the TV station in the channel selector for you. No more manually entering TV call station identifiers.The picture screen is actually very impressive for 720p. Small and light enough to set on a wooden dresser without fear of imprints on the finish. Very good sound quality. Remote is simple for any age. I highly recommend for the price and quality."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Saw others complaining about the base. Make sure to use the screws provided to connect the base to the TV otherwise it will be extremely wobble-y! I think that's probably what happened to the other owners.Working well so far. Had it 2 weeks. Bought to replace an old CRT TV  with glitchy volume that I had in my room. Sound is much better, and it doubles as a second monitor for my Laptop using http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-Meters/dp/B003L1ZYYM/ref=cm_cr-mr-title to connect. Confusing to use headphones on because it will switch between using the computer speakers and the TV speakers for audio, but can be figured out using trial and error."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I know I could have purchased a cheaper 19"" television set for our kitchen but we have a 46"" Samsung for our main set and love it.  The purchase was also based on third party ratings of small sets.  It was very easy to attach the base and the set was hooked up to an outside antenna which runs though an amplifier.  We are picking up over 30 channels with this set and it was very easy to scan in the channels.Remote was easy to use and similar to the one we have for the larger set.  It has some nice features we were not expecting and we especially like the ""Channel List"" which displays the channels programmed into the set and what show is currently on.Would highly recommend this set for kitchen, dorm, office, etc. where ever there is limited space."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I bought this for one of my work rooms. It sets on a shelf above the work bench. Since the stand is not adjustable, the TV has an option on the menu to choose a ""Lean Back"" setting that adjust the viewing angle so you can get a good picture even viewing from below the TV. It also has a ""Standing"" option.I'm just hooked up to a cable so I can't comment on any of the other input features.Cons:I do wish it had a ""Favorites"" button on the remote to let you advance through your favorite channels. To view your favorite channels you have to go through menu options each time.There is supposed to be an option for the TV to adjust the brightness automatically based on the light in the room but for some reason I can't activate that feature. The option is gray, non-selectable."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Yes, all previous reviews are true. Nothing wrong with this tv except the cheap stand that's very difficult to put on."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This TV is OK. Good sound. But the color is just kind of off and I can't get it to look great after lots of adjustments.Also, there is NO AUDIO INPUT which was a giant disappointment"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This TV fit the space for a it in our new 5th wheel trailer, have not used very much yet but it has a great picture and the sound is good. looking forward to enjoying in the very near future."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,the stand that comes with the tv is a cheap plastic and it hard to connect to the tv.  nice little tv though but due to the stand I give this a two star because the stand is a pretty important part
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I got this to replace my old 12&#34; tv for my kitchen counter.  I chose Samsung since we had purchased a 42&#34; one for our living room 3 years ago and were very satisfied with that purchase.  This tv is a nice size, perfect for the space I keep the kitchen tv in.  My only complaint is that the sound is very &#34;tinny&#34;.  I plan to look and see if there is a place to hook up a pair of small speakers to to help fix that problem.  Other than that I am happy with the purchase."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I got this for the headphone jack, but I really don't like the TV. It has no real cord. The cord has a somewhat bulky detachable AC adapter, which I don't like. The TV is too short like many LED TV's and not easily tilted downward toward my bed. Base is too small. Doesn't seem slim. Reception poor. The red light is on the right bottom side and not the center. I would never buy any Samsung TV for my bedroom ever again, unless it was the only headphone jack TV on the market."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"When the ancient CRT based TV in our guest room expired I was looking for a good replacement.I checked locally and no one had a good name brand smaller LED / LCD TV.  There were a few off brand models, or I could order one at a local store.This TV was at a really good price point for a Samsung.  Not much more to say.  Worked great out of the box.  Setup was very easy.Picture quality is excellent.  Sound quality is good enough for its intended purpose.  Can't say about the HDMI inputs as we don't need those at this time.I would recommend this TV if you need a smaller format model."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Nice tv for nice price.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This was purchased for a small off fits perfect great sound clear picture, remote is clear and to the point colors are perfect no complaints...."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Great for being able to watch some Netflix in bed. Picture isn't the best, but it's not as bad as I've seen on other inexpensive TVs. Some decent settings to adjust the brightness, color, etc... Sound is pretty good. Overall it's an great, inexpensive small TV. Don't expect it to blow you away with cinema-quality performance."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This is quite a nice TV. It replaces my trusty Sony stereo 13&#34;. My monthly electric bill has gone down by $35 due to this replacement. It was a good move and this is a truly beautiful picture with nice stereo sound. I have cable TV and the 720P works great. 1080P might be nicer on paper, but with TVs of this size there would probably be little improvement. Sports will be fine with at 60HZ. March madness was beautiful.I have read reports of unsteady stands. You just have to tighten the screws down until they won't turn any more. Pretend that they are self tapping screws and everything will be fine. I would buy another one and if I get to the place where a larger TV would be needed I will buy another Samsung."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Great picture, price and TV. Very light and perfect for a wall mounted TV in a limited space area. Ours is in the kitchen."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"For general home use, as we do in the kitchen, this TV provides a decent-enough picture and adequate sound for the casual or passive viewing and listening experience that it is being used for.  It is very economical to operate considering its 12-volt DC power supply.  It is very compact for use on the kitchen counter and below cabinets.  However, the only negative is that with the need to use the power adapter, plus make cable connections from the source to a digital box and then to the TV, there's a lot of cables and wiring to try and conceal when sitting on a relatively-open kitchen cabinet.  A more simplified or condensed power supply with less cords/wires would be more appealing."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"There aren't many major brand Flat Panel TVs that will fit under the upper cabinet in your kitchen. We have 2 other Samsung TV's in the house and are very happy with them.  It was a nice surprise to find this model for our kitchen.  Its also nice to have the same remote control design in 3 rooms.  The picture is great and the sound is pretty good for the small speakers facing down from the bottom edge.A year ago we bought a 22"" Visio for the kitchen.  It fit because it has no stand to increase its height.  The sound on the 22"" Vizio was poor . . often hard to understand speech on some programs with the Vizio.The TV is very light weight.  To allow the TV to turn on the granite counter, I removed the sticky rubber feet and put on felt pads available at hardware stores for chair feet. The felt pads are very slippery so you can spin the TV with a finger tip.Two Minor shortcomings for our needs:1. TV has only 1 HDMI input. Our primary program source is HDMI, but with Amazon-Prime and NetFlix subscriptions we also ordered a RoKu3 module to play Amazon/NetFlix programming to this TV. It would be nice not to have to use an external HDMI switch.  (We just discovered RoKu - its the competitor to the Apple TV module, but usually considered better than Apple TV unless most of your other gadgets are also Apple)2. This TV has an external power block like your notebook computer.  On our Peninsula kitchen counter, we turn this TV to face the Kitchen or Dinette. It would be nice to not have this power block to hide.  Being compulsive about tidy electronics installations, I lengthened the low voltage power wire on the power block and placed it in the unfinished basement below the TV. Now we only have the thin black low-voltage power wire going into a wall plate along with the HDMI feed from the basement. The DishTV and Roku remote controls are both Radio-Frequency so the DishTV HDMI-module and RokU-Module can be in the basement below the TV.Overall, we are really happy to find this great TV that is only 12.5"" tall with the stand.  If you really need 2 HDMI inputs and are OK with the higher price, look at the 19"" Toshiba TVToshiba 19L4200U 19-Inch 720p 60Hz LED TV (Black)"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This t.v. went into a spare bedroom, the picture is so clear and the sound is great.  I like Samsung products,,"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I was excited to get this Samsung at such a low price. Picture quality is top notch and speaker volume is more than plenty. We are using it in the kitchen and can see it from all angles to no need to rotate the TV horizontally or vertically to get a clear picture.  Definitely a great buy.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,For a small TV it really surprised me.  The picture is great and it meets all my expectations.  This is my first HD TV I have purchased for my home.  With a special box from Charter it even gives me the channels that are scrambled by Charter unless their box is attached.  It was a  very easy setup and all instructions were clearly spelled out.  I recommend this purchase.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This product is perfect for plane rides. It doesn't completely remove the engine noise, but it puts it so far into the background that you won't even notice it. And there's very little chance you'll actually be able to hear people talk around you.For every day use, I'd pick up some other headphones. The only reason to buy these is for the noise cancellation. Unless you live next to the highway, you should use other headphones with better sound quality."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I already own a pair of Bose Around ear headphones(AE2) and wanted to give this a try.These headphones beat my expectations. They are very comfortable to wear,sound the best i heard till date and most of all, the noise cancelling is awesome.These take just one AAA battery as opposed two by Beats and Souls..and the battery life is amazing. Overall these headphones are worth their price and are the best you can get in this price range. Get this one and you wont be disappointed!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've had this headphone for over a year now. I've used if for everything from intense gaming to audiophiling to drowning out  some annoying sounds. I have only a couple complaints. Considering the fact that the QC15 is $300, the quality and build of this headphone feels a bit plasticy. Because of this, It is a tiny bit fragile. The headphone itself will wear down over time. My second complaint is that when the battery is low, the ear phones turn on and off WHENEVER you move or touch the headphones making an annoying click sound. Other than that, The Bose QC 15 is a great headphone. Remember, the QC 15 was designed mainly for travel so these are at its best on an airplane. In fact, these are so good that airlines let people use QC15s during flight in 1st class. These are superb at blocking out low end sounds but are not as good for high end sounds such as high voices. Paired with some music, the QC15 can be one of those headphones where people get pissed at you because you can't hear them and they think you are ignoring them. The audio quality is a little bit above standard but not amazing. The bass is a tad bit... dry. BUT, for gaming, the QC15 is amazing not because of its sound quality but because of its noise cancellation. With Skyrim on full blast and Noise cancellation turned on, I doubt I could hear a jet engine 2 feet away from my ears! The QC15 is the ultimate immersion headphone when gaming. No distractions, no background noise, just you and your game. Overall, for $300 bucks, this headphone is pretty good!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are amazing.Blocks out almost all the ambient noises on airplane...especially the loud vibrations of the engines. Make your plane ride much more relaxing.It would be nice if it could also block out other people's conversations. You are still able to hear people around you talking, but that doesn't bother me too much."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these to wear on airplane trips and such, where they do wonders to drown out engine sounds, and other things that generate low frequency noises. I also find myself wearing them to the grocery store, and other noisy places, just because I like listening to music more than screaming kids :)The one thing I DON'T like is the on/off switch. I wish it were a soft button that auto turned itself off after a few minutes of no audio. As it stands, I forget to turn these off a lot, so when I go to use them again, the battery is dead :P"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bose has earned its title.  Excellent noise cancelling effect.  At the same price, I feel it better than Monster dr. dre studio."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these headphones 2 years ago. I use them every day - virtually everywhere I go.  I am a long-time drummer and at age 58, still gig on a regular basis. Through the years I have owned and tried a ton of headphones by many manufacturers. Many great brands are available in ALL price ranges. Sennheiser, Audio Technica, Sony just to name  few.Why did I buy these?Well...I am very careful about wearing ear plugs while drumming - to protect myself from hearing loss. Because of this, I thought that the noise canceling feature would allow me to enjoy my music without turning them up loud to drown out background  distractions. This choice paid off...in MOST situations. Overall, they work very well - sound reproduction is very good - from classical, jazz, rock and roll to hip hop to r&b.; For most people, they will serve them well.Are there better buys and headphones out there? Yes...but considering the overall performance (and COMFORT), they are a good choice for most people. Would I recommend to friends? YES!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I never understood what the big whoop was about noise cancelling headphones.  But when I saw everyone on planes in first class using them-AND some planes offering them on select flights I had to check out WHY.  for one, if you travel, as I do, I have found one of the most exhausting things is the constant sound of the plane.  the headphones cut way down on that right off the bat.  plus those hideous little freebies (or 2 dollar) headphones on planes dont do anything to cut down on noise  with the BOSE--you plug in and instantly cut down on the noise even if you are not listening to anything at all. and when you do listen to something--the noise of the plane is gone and the sound of the movies or music is fantastic.  I do wish the cord was a bit more substantial and i have unplugged them from the headphones themselves by accident (with my foot) so you have to be a little careful with them. but at this price you would treat them gently anyway.  Nice and light compared to &#34;professional&#34; headphones which tend to give me an ear ache after a while.  I now never ever travel without these.  worth every penny to me."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I've had these for about a month and the comfort of these headphones on my ears and the noise cancellation is what made me keep these. The sound is very good and I know that other headphones have better sound but these things are pillows on my ears and it sounds very good and the noise cancellation is really that good. I have a hard time hearing anything even when my wife is speaking directly towards me with the Bose QC 15 on. I actually just returned a warehouse deal on V-Moda 100's ($251) because of the headphones being too tight fitting around my ears but they sounded great and the volume of these where the highest with a iPhone (it was skull jarring).  I have a pair of Beats Studios currently which are great if you want very loud bass heavy and I use it mainly for my Xbox because of the boom of gunshots and explosions. I prefer the Bose for long periods of music listening and my long flights from Hawaii. You will like these especially for the price now.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had this one and Audio Technica M50 at the same time. First time, I heard both of these. It was 50% that I would return Bose. After two weeks, Bose went back to the store. The sound of M50 is much tighter, cleaner. Both mid range vocal and trebles were smoother. I enjoyed all kind of music with M50. Bose have more base but not deep and precise like M50. I give 2 stars for this because of comfort when wearing it. Bose is lighter and fit better on me. But the sound quality still won. I decided to return QC15 NOT because of the price. I would do the same even for same price as M50...I know many people still like QC15 but try M50 also before make your decision."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Like many others, I make fun of Bose on a regular basis for being ""all marketing rather than product"".  And many of their car systems truly deserve a well earned raspberry.  These, however, are touted as being really good at one thing and that's noise cancellation while traveling.  Any given commercial flight today will have at least one person wearing a set of these more than likely and there's a great reason for that.  They just flat out work.  There's a lot of stuff I don't want to hear while flying: engine noise, wind noise, flight attendants, pilots, screaming babies, the annoying lady sitting next to me, etc.  Put these on, voila.  Problem solved, all those annoying noises go away or are at least greatly attenuated.  I've heard better sounding headphones but the QC15s are super comfortable for me, provide excellent noise cancellation and make flying a much more pleasant experience IMHO.  Along with a good carrying case and the ability for the first year at least to replace at any Bose store, they're one of my essential travel tools.  It really is true for me - I arrive much less frazzled with these now.  Expensive but if you want the best noise cancellation units at a semi-reasonable price currently?"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Been through 4 of them. It is always one side that will quit working or you get intermittent signal on one side. See other reviews. Great product for noise cancel and comfort but they must use very thin cables between each side. I will say the warranty has been honored each time at a cost of $80 exchange each time. Quality is TERRIBLE.And I do not abuse the headphones in any manner other that normal use. I take care of products I purchase.My headphone list includes:And not one has broken yet I've gone through 4 Bose QC15 in 3 years:Grado SR-60, Grado SR-80, Sennheisers HD555, HD595, HD600, HD650, ATM-50S, Ultrasone HFI-780, AKG 701Q.All are mint condition including the SR-60 which I have had for 7 plus years."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,What can one say - these are the gold standard.  Pricey and somewhat bulky - but you won't hear someone sitting next to you!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"What I like:-The best active noise-cancelling, period. I would describe the sensation more as being in a vacuum then having pressure on the ears-The most comfortable around the ear headphones I have ever used due to light weight, light clamping pressure, nice headband cushioning, and plush earpads-Plastic construction makes it light, and therefore comfortable-User replaceable earpads-Detachable audio cable with low/high switch to control volume-Decent audio performanceWhat I don't like:-Bass is one-tone and highs are sometimes shrill to the point of hurting my earsSound and comfort when compared to Klipsch Image One, Harman Kardon CL, B&W; P5, Logitech UE6000, Sennheiser Momentum:-Klipsch Image One is too bass-heavy. Comfort is merely OK because the cushions are so small they straddle the line between circum-aural and on-ear-Harman Kardon CL has solid but not overwhelming bass and clear mids and highs. Unique headband mechanism is comfortable for half an hour but becomes uncomfortable if worn for longer periods-B&W; P5: Although this was by far the best-looking out of all the headphones, I found it to have a somewhat hollow sound especially when compared to the Harman Kardon CL. A very tight (and unadjustable) clamping force made listening very uncomfortable even for brief periods. That, plus the questionable durability (just go into any apple store and see how beat up the leather pads get over time), made me feel this was overpriced at $300-Logitech UE6000 will have more prominent bass with active noise cancellation function turned on with better clarity in the mids and highs with noise cancellation turned off. It is very comfortable (not as much as QC15). Users may notice an audible ""hiss"" due to the noise cancellation-Sennheiser Momentum has crisp but not shrill highs and a nice bass. Comfort is close to the QC15 as long as your ears fit into the plush cushions, and overall weight is a barely-there 190gFor sound quality I would rank Sennheiser Momentum>Logitech UE6000=Harman Kardon CL>B&W; P5>Klipsch One=Bose QC15For comfort Bose QC15>Sennheiser Momentum>Logitech UE6000>>Harman Kardon CL=Klipsch One=B&W; P5For noise isolation Bose QC15>>Logitech UE6000 (active mode)>Harman Kardon CL>Sennheiser Momentum>B&W; P5=Klipsch OneGet QC15 if you're a frequent traveler who wants to drown out all noise. Looks elsewhere if you're an audiophile."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"As a frequent flyer, I'm on the road a lot. I also make a good amount of trips overseas. Previously, I put earplugs in and set the volume of the provided headsets as high as possible so I could somewhat understand what was being said in the movies. Once I received this birthday present, I couldn't believe the difference it made in traveling. Not only am I able to hear everything crystal clear, it is so comfortable over my ears that I have no problems keeping it on for 10 hours straight. The 1 AAA battery lasts me a week or more of heavy use.The sound quality it provides is exellent and cables and extension pieces are provided to fit 1-pin and 2-pin connectors for planes. I cannot come up with anything negative to say about this product. Also, from what I've heard of friends of mine is that the customer service of Bose is outstanding.Awesome product!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Absolutely wonderful on planes. Listening to music or watching movies on iPad and iPhone. Of course would be just as good anywhere you want to cancel out noise, even if you don't listen to anything else.Always remember to store with the battery removed. I have experienced many AA cells leaking lately."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I work in an office environment where the powers that be put us into something called a pod where they put four people in the pod.  The theory is that it is to improve team collaboration.  The truth is that we do collaborate more, but that there are far too many disruptions that just aren't necessary, because it is still way too easy to be distracted and pulled into random conversations.  We all owned our own headphones, my own were some highly rated Sennheisers.  I thought that they did a pretty good job at isolating me from the random office chatter, but I was wrong.  My boss just bought all of us these Bose QC15 headphones and I can tell you that I now get hours of uninterrupted concentration per day now, when before it was probably never more than 30 minutes.I've tried noise canceling headphones before, but nothing has performed like this.  They always had a bit of an annoying hiss and also didn't really cut out much more than continuous noise, like an airplane engine.  These do a MUCH better job.  There is no noticeable hiss and although I can still here voices here and there, they are much more muffled and much less distracting.Well done, Bose.  I always thought you were a gimmick company suckering people to pay too much, but these things are pretty amazing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Great headphones, sounds quality is more than adequate, and noise cancellation is fantastic.  Although, there are plenty of reviews that address sound quality and noise cancellation, so I'll leave it at that.I simply want to acknowledge that the phone controls do NOT work with Android phones.  I've tried it with my Samsung Galaxy S Captivate and the phone is completely unresponsive to these buttons, but the inline mic does work.That's a pretty weak showing on Bose's part! How can Bose put so much effort into quality head phones and completely over 40% of mobile phone users??"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If you were sold by the ads touting the QuietComfort 15 as giving you a ""concert hall"" in your head while flying, you'll be disappointed. The active noise cancellation dampens engine noise modestly. It also works for HVAC systems and other mechanical vibrations. It does nothing for the sounds that actually make flying unbearable: crying babies, obnoxious yelling, incessant in-flight announcements.Still, it's enough. With the QC 15, you can watch a movie or listen to a podcast without cranking up the volume to ear-damaging levels. That's wonderful. They're also really, truly comfortable, more than any other headphones I've tried: very light, with large padded cups that fit around your ears rather than putting pressure on them. I can wear these for hours without feeling any neck strain or pinching. I could fall asleep with these on. That's remarkable.In travel, these are an unrivaled luxury. Elsewhere, though, they're lackluster. I wish they could be used without the active noise cancellation, which feels slightly weird when it's not needed and quickly devours AAA batteries. Until Bose solves that problem, I feel like I need a separate pair of headphones to wear at home.Oh, as to the confusingly named QC 3: They're slightly more portable, but have lower audio quality (according to a Bose employee I spoke to), use a proprietary battery that has to be replaced or recharged more often, and cost $50 more. So, I would definitely choose the QC 15."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I get this mainly for its' wonderful noise cancelling capability. It help me to concentrate in the office while working in a noisy environment. I also fly long haul quite often and this has been a savior for me as it help me so that I can have a proper rest on the plane without the hissing engine sound. However if you are looking for sound quality, get a Sennheiser HD600/650 or HD800 with a proper DAC & amp. They are built for Sound Quality while this Bose QC15 are built for noise cancelling headphone.Another thing, I've had ATH-ANC7b for 3 years now and I'd say that the $250 difference is worth it. ANC7b is much bigger (both the cans & the cases) and also lose in terms of noise cancelling capabilities. Sound quality is also inferior. I'm currently looking to sell my ANC7b now as I'm happy with this pair of can.Again, the conclusion is if you want to get the best NC headphone around, this is the one, but if you are looking for SQ, get a Sennheiser HD600/650/800."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It's been a long journey, I've purchased, tried and returned many headphones, thinking there was a way to avoid paying the Bose price.  But at the end of the day, these headphones are just so much better than anything in their class!Comfort - I've worn them for hours at a time, in my wood shop, on airplanes, in my office or just trying to grab a little peace and quiet in the easy chair. They're so light and comfortable.Fidelity - I believe I have a pretty discerning ear and can testify these phones are more than worthy for any music.  They're not heavy in any particular range and provide an accurate and balanced frequency response.  I use them on my iPhone, iPad and home entertainment equipment, no complaints.  If you're partial to boosting a particular frequency range, just dial up your equalizer.Noise Cancelation - Let's face it folks, Bose wrote the book on active noise cancelation.  They simply work far better than anything out there that I've tested.  Couple this technology with the passive isolation of the oh so comfortable, headphone pads and head set design and it's just you and your programing.The iPhone microphone and function switches work as advertised.  I only wish these headphones were wireless, but I guess you just can't have everything.  Bottom line, if you're looking for the best darn noise canceling earphones ever made, buy these, you won't be disappointed."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have owned three different NC headphones and these are the gold standard. At home, in the car or on a plane."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are well-adapted for use on planes & trains --- good acoustic isolation, very good noise cancellation, cord on one side only, and reasonably compact. Sound quality is not the primary concern for these situations.But in normal use, sound quality is their downfall. Quite different from the audiophile sound Bose hypes, they are heavily tweaked, mid-range-weak, unnatural sound, perhaps good for heavily amped rock music but pretty poor for classical, or indeed any unzapped acoustic, music.Another annoyance is that the headphones have no passive mode. They ONLY work with the noise cancellation switched on.I feel like I've paid for Bose's marketing, not for good headphones.(Note: I bought these from Amazon but do not show up as a confirmed buyer because I'd bought the ""special edition"" ones, identical except for the color)."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought a decent, lower-priced set of sound-cancelling earphones by another manufacturer a few years ago. What a waste! The sound quality of these Bose earphones is truly amazing. If you listen to serious music, aka ""classical,"" please don't waste your money on other products. This is as close as it gets to being there. I'm hearing things I just assumed one could not hear outside of the concert hall. I am so glad I finally bought these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these as a gift for a co-worker.  I had had mine for about 1 year and he always inquired about them when we traveled together.  I have been extremely satisfied with the performance of these headphones.  They are an awesome item and long flight or even short ones.  They isolate you quite well from cabin noise as well as other passengers.  My only complaints are size and occasional performance issues.Size:These things are quite big.  In the day in age of being nickled and dimed during any travel experience for bag fees and neary fist fighting for overhead bin space, size matters.  The included soft sided case is quite nice but again size is an issue.  I find them difficult to fit into my bag at times but their benefits far out weight the minor annoyance of finding a place to cram them into.Performance Issues:Occasionally a fellow traveler seems to have a natural voice frequency that simpler cannot be &#34;noise-canceled&#34; by these things.  I was on a long flight from LA to ORD and felt like Fran Drescher was seated behind me and was further appalled when I determined my headphones could not cancel out her bone cutting voice.Overall worth every stinking penny!!!  You will wonder how you traveled without them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Works great, more comfortable than their other options in my oppion. cheaper and more comfortable = home run. will probably buy another pair eventually (my old pair 5 years old are still working flawlessly)."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The sound is good, and the headphone is really comfortable. BUT:- You cant use it with the noise cancelling off, so you will ALWAYS be dependent on battery.- It doesnt has a auto-off after no use time for the noice cancelling, so when you forget it on, good bye battery.- Not surround 5.1 or 7.1.- Noise cancelling is nothing special... It works for airconditioning sound, and plane sound.Buy it if you like comfortable headphones with a good sound quality. But, in my opinion, it doesnt worth the 300 dollars."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had been considering the Q15s or the Beats by Dre Studio headphones for awhile. I would test them in the stores and ask my friends and it was a pretty even split between the two. The Beats seem a bit heavier on the bass but the Bose are crisper on everything else. Deep lows, fantastic surround sound, good noise canceling, and sexy design make these headphones well worth the price. I was on the plane and was awoken by a crying baby, put these bad boys on and went right back to sleep in peace and quiet. The noise canceling seem to cancel out consistent lower tones. People talking loudly or alarms or other high pitched loud noises can be heard, but are greatly reduced in sound, to the point where you can ignore it and burn down with a house on fire. My biggest beef is that the iPod/iphone connection is cool but you can't change songs with it, just pause and volume. It is a great buy though."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm really, really pleased with these. I got them to make long airplane flights more bearable, and they do that very well! They make the bad sounds go away, far away. They are big enough to cover your ears, but smaller and lighter than I had imagined they would be.  Comfortable enough and light enough to wear for very extended periods.  The noise cancellation works very well and produced no irritating effects that I was aware of.  I read in some other reviews that the sound reproduction is not &#34;audiophile&#34; quality.  That may be.. I have some nice Shure earbuds that are much brighter than these.. but these have a most pleasing quality to them, a fullness and a robust bass and maybe a little off the top end, that makes them so easy to listen to for long periods of time.  I used them on two flights of 12 hours each.  They didn't hurt my ears, they didn't become tiresome to listen to, and they didn't wear down, in fact all 24 hours were on ONE battery!  The compact hard-shell travel case is very nice to have, and has room to hold spare batteries and an adapter or two.  The only improvement I can imagine would be some kind of sensor to detect when they are not in use and turn off the power.  You have to remember to manually switch it off when you put them away, or you will run down the battery.  However, that's a minor complaint; they do have a little LED that indicates power on, it's facing you when you put them away, and you just have to remember to flip the switch and power down before you close the case.  I'm very happy with my purchase, and would highly recommend them to others."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I suppose there is something even more amazing out there and that even Bose makes it. But at this price point, it is 1. a sanity saver and 2. Nice quality sound. The hard part is remembering to turn them off when not in use. If I remember to turn them off, I can use them on long flights and for a LONG time. If I just leave them turned on for 24 hours straight, well, one teensy battery doesn't make it. But the fact they run on one teensy, easily transportable, readily found battery makes them light and convenient. (AAA). They are worth the space in the carry on, and few things are."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones was exactly what i was looking for. it does cancel out all background noice, exept my wife. i actually dont need music when im out flying, but i can hear much better what people are saying. dont like that they dont work at all witout battery doh."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I really enjoy these although they are pricey.  I use them in a communications environment.  The noise cancelling works very well.  I wish someone would come up with some headphones that could be powered via the audio cable.  I end up going through a lot of batteries.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I used this headphone over a transatlantic flight, 13+ hours one way. The noise canceling is simply amazing. When you put it on, it basically cancel all the ambient noise, except a little. This is simply amazing. As far as I am aware, this is the best noise canceling headphone out there.1. Sound quality is good. Not enough bass but it is probably acceptable since its primary use is noise canceling.2. During flight, you will have to put the volume to 40% to hear clear sound of TV or audio program. To listen to the same video on aeroplane provided headphone, you to listen at 90% of volume. But the 40% volume of boss is *much* clear and *much* enjoyable than than 90% volume by regular headphone.3. Sometime the pilot will interrupt and make an announcement. This can be extremely loud on this headphone, almost deafening. I did not have problem with it going back (may there were not such announcement or they were on normal volume) but on my way back, it was terrible to hear those announcement on this headphone.4.They are pretty comfortable on air for long flight. I did felt quite pressurized when I wore it for a while but I know that is not headphone fault. It is just that our ears are not used to have something on it for a long period of time.5. The biggest draw back of this headphone is, when the battery runs out, it is garbage. Yes, it is completely garbage. It will not work as regular headphone (without noise canceling headphone).So I do appreciate the headphone with it superb noise canceling quality, it is truly a remarkable product. But the fact that it does not work without batteries is a serious disadvantage and rather expensive if you look at that.My personnel opinion is, this is not a necessary. We human pretty much get used our environment what ever it is, even if it a bit noise in the plane. I have been some extremely loud aeroplanes, in that case it will be a boon. Listening to TV shows become far more enjoyable with this headphone. I would consider it as luxury item."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The Good- Best overall headphone experience I've ever had, and that's saying a lot I have many sets of headphones.- You get what you pay for here.- Great Noise Cancelation, totally blocks out annoying hums, airplane noise or crowd noise. Don't worry you'll still be able to hear people trying to get your attention.- Build quality is excellent, just what you'd expect from Bose.- Sound quality is excellent.- Hands down the most comfortable headphones I've ever tried on. I have worn these for hours without the slightest discomfort.- The head band is positioned more forward than most headphones so that you can wear them laying down with your head on a pillow if you have to.- Noise cancelation works even with cable unplugged. Keep in mind they do have to be turned on and it will still drain the battery.- Includes a very nice case that is much more low profile than I expected.- I've Used the heck out of these and I'm still on the original battery that came with them. I think battery life is around 30 hours.My Criticisms- It does take 1 aaa battery. Carry an extra battery or two if your traveling, because if the battery dies they don't work at all. Battery life is great.- If you accidentally leave them on it will drain the battery. Thankfully there is an on indicator light that has saves me from leaving them on several times.- Eventually you get used to switching them off as you take them off your head, so this is not much of an issue.Bottom LineThe Bose Quiet Comfort 15's are solidly built, sound great, look great, Noise cancellation works better than anything else on the market, They include a nice case, you really can't go wrong with these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am not a huge Bose fan.  I often think there products are average and overpriced.  I am getting ready for a trip to Europe and need a very good set of headphones with noise cancellation.  After countless research on product review and speaking with several friends, I decided to give Bose another try.  Overall, I was very impressed with these headsets.  It comes nicely packaged with a very durable carrying case.  On a scale of 10, I would rate the quality of the headsets at 10.  They are very well made - better than I expected.  The headsets fit perfectly and very soft and light - should be no problem for a long trip.  The noise cancellation feature seems to work great.  It battery powered, but it works.  So far, I am very happy with my purchase."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If Bose could package this noise cancelling technology in a headphone that was actually well constructed (example: the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x), I'd be in heaven.  The headphones are sort of dorky looking, and plasticy... The sound quality is pretty decent (nothing near the ATH-M50x, but decent). I'm just not impressed at all with the build on these. Even the audio cable is flimsey and cheap... But damn their noise cancelling technology is good. If that's what you really want, then these may be the ticket.With that said, these put enough pressure on your eardrums to be noticeable.  I was able to deal with it, but my GF wasn't... So be warned, these aren't for everyone."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I want to focus this review on what the main purpose of these headphones is ... to cancel out unwanted background noise, especially when flying.  I've owned a pair of Sony NC phones prior to this and they did a good job.  This pair of headphones does an EXCELLENT job.  I fly a lot (weekly) and having this little respite from the noise of the flight is a pleasure.  My advice is to take Bose up on their 30 day money back guarantee and try them.  The background quiets down a little when you put them on and when you hit the power switch, it's like walking into a quiet room.  Does the noise go away completely?  Of course not.  Does the noise level drop like a rock?  You bet.  These headphones do what they were designed to do.Just a comment on sound quality.  Is the sound reproduction as good as my $500 Sennheisers?  Of course not.  But it is very good on this Bose pair and also, if I were to use the Sennheisers on an airplane, I'm pretty sure the perceived sound reproduction would not be perfect either.  These headphones are intended to balance noise cancelling with sound quality and they do this very well.The only downside is battery usage but it's more of an inconvenience than a cost issue.  The headset uses inexpensive AAA batteries but life (as stated by Bose support) is about 24 hours.  I'm guessing less, like about 15 to 20.  These headphones won't let you listen to music if the battery is dead like my Sony phones did, so I suggest putting a spare or two in the pocket of the included hard shell carry pouch."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel a lot and wouldn't dream of leaving without my Bose headsets. The only issue I have is that you cannot listen to them without them turned on. If you do purchase them, do yourself a favor and carry an extra battery in the carrying case, you'll be glad you did."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Why I should have given the money to Church instead:- Average sound quality and lesser base(non too essential unless that's what you care)- Not made to last and so is the leather muffle.- Wire connection for to headphone and device will losen overtime so does the quality of sound taken factor.- Short battery life(not an issue if you use rechargable. Recommand Rayvac from Target great battery and cheap)- No improvement since QC2- Hit and run customer service. Only option for customer is pay 100-150 USD to replace a new. Yes you do have to quite stright and rude. Screaming their ears off and no compomise. (had to replace my QC2 quit for no reason)- Over rated price which took totally different ideal from their original founder. Initial founder believe in fair price and quality sound for all.- One good of all sad faces. Light I often forget I had them on. Where is my glasses? (oh it's on my head)- I will give it as a good ear warmer during winter time too.I am not a professional sound track personal. However I will not dull myself due to paying expensive price then believe I own the best. I firmly believe even Royce has it's down falls.Some say Stax are fine set. I did not earn it yet so that's up to you to find out.Choices are naturally up to you. But I hope I could at least shead some pre buy knowledge to you. I personally dont want to give company such as Bose a chance to survive. Take a good thought why do you love Amazon. Whereas Bose has become rodent of society.From customer that demands uncompromised quality,Work hard and be willing to pay/support to whom deserves,Ted"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I used to own the $300.00 Beat by Dre.  I thought those were amazing, they broke and my friend said he will never use anything but Bose.  I decided it was my turn.  Not a fan of putting batteries in headphones but with the phenomenal noise cancellation and the clearness of the music I will always own these.  I can hear my self think"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought the Bose QuietComfort 15 Noise Cancelling Headphones about a month ago and am thoroughly impressed thus far.Sound Quality: As odd as this may sound, I feel like I haven't ever listened to any of my songs! This headset completely revamps every song. You will hear things in some of your favorite songs you haven't heard before. As it says in the title, this is an acoustic headset so don't expect loud and powerful base. If you like a lot of base then this isn't the headset for you.Noise Cancelling: I find that I can still hear people talking while I am on a plane but most of the background noise goes away. I would describe the sound as if you are underwater or plugging your ears, to give you an idea of the sound. When you play some light music in the background, all the people talking tend to dissappear. I take up anywhere from 50 to 100 flights in a year and now that I own a Bose headset, I couldn't imagine not having it with me.Comfort: The headset is extremely comfortable with leather around the ear and the leather on the top of the headset. This makes it very comfortable for long periods of time. I used to use ear buds and found that my ears started to hurt after 30 minutes. The only thing I will mention is that your ears do get a bit hot a sweaty after a while so it is good to give them a breath of fresh air every hour or so.Carrying Case: In this box comes with a carrying case to help protect your Bose headset. This was a huge selling feature for me because with all the travelling I do, I was worried about ruining my headset. This allows me to put the case in my bag and not have to worry that I am crushing it. Great addition Bose!Cord: Although this headset isn't wireless, it has a detachable cord which I find very useful. If you don't want to listen to anything, don't attach the cord and you can relax with noise cancelling feature. If you do want to listen to music or watch a movie, attach the cord. Easy.Batteries: The headset runs on (1) AAA battery which fits right into a nice location on the headset. I keep an extra AAA battery in my carrying case just in case it dies while I am travelling. I haven't had to replace the battery yet and I have used it for quite a few flights. I am very impressed with how long it lasts!Airplane connector: Bose also included an airplane connector which some airlines still use. I haven't come across a time I have had to use this but it certainly is nice to have if I need it.Downfalls: There isn't much I would change about the Bose QC 15 but the most important one would be that I can't listen to music if my battery is dead. Again this hasn't happened to me but if my battery were to die, I can't listen to music. You have to have the noise cancelling feature on to listen to anything. Other than that, there is nothing I would change.Price: This headset is quite pricey so it isn't meant for the average person. There are other headsets that I would recommend. But if you are the type of person who travels a lot of find yourself in locations where the noise bothers you (ie train, bus, etc), this is the headset for you.Well done Bose, you have turned my into a believer and I couldn't imagine travelling without my Quiet Comfort 15!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"So I'm not one to spend $300 on a set of headphones, and I didn't, 6 of my friends did collectively on VenTribe.comBut I've since bought my dad them, because you get what you pay for. I'll keep this short and sweet:- Unreal sound quality (better than any headphones I've ever used)- Really comfortable - they look quite big but sit nicely- Noise cancelling really does mean exactly that unlike a lot of cheaper alternatives.And with the switch of a button, you can switch from music to using your phone.I love them"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Just not what I expected. I do a bit of airline travel and have almost always used a CD player (before iPods) or an iPod. Have used earbuds-only but was not pleased with all the additional noise. Picked up a pair of noise cancelling headphones a fellow employee had left behind about 10 years ago....and used them for several years. I don't know who the manufacturer was for those but they were/are adequate but the ear pieces fit on the ear rather than over and around. Not the most comfortable. Have always thought about getting the Bose. First, they are very comfortable. No problems wearing them on a 4 hour flight. With the caveat that I am older AND that I have a hearing impairment from a viral infection a few years ago, I was not at all happy with the quality of the sound on the Bose headphones. (It's a given that, as you age, you slowly lose your ability to hear high pitch.) The Bose were simply far too bass-ey for my taste. I've gone back to the older set which -- for me -- sound much better. Seems for the price, Bose could incorporate an in-line equalizer. (I have an idea that many people would find that the Bose are not bass-ey enough.) With an equalizer, everyone could choose their own 'mix'. A real plus -- which I had only experienced with a couple of early-model Kindles -- is the great return policy and method of Amazon. Quick, easy and the money is returned very quickly. However, even so, I would encourage others to do what I did not do: find a pair to 'test' before you actually spring for the purchase."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is the first time and hopefully the last that I spend $300 on a pair of headphones, but let me tell you if you're going on a long international flight it is well worth it.  It is amazing how much background noise gets eliminated by the noise cancellation, and the sound of the headphones is a perfect balance of treble and bass.  Not too much bass, like other headphones but just the right amount."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are lite, fit over my ears, and the insides of the cans don't touch, or press against my ears as some headphones do. The noise cancelling is good, but not the strongest I've had. They seem to be better at cancelling out sounds with more bass instead of high tones like phones ringing. They have very little pressure from the cancellation circuitry compared to other noise cancelling headphones I've tried, and I can wear them for hours at a time with no discomfort.  They sound great, amazing how good they sound on my computer, they even sound good on my Sangean portable radio.For the money Bose charges, the cans should provide better noise isolation before the cancelling circuitry is turned on.  I used to have a pair of Panasonic noise cancelling headphones that blocked a good amount of noise before turning on the cancelling. I would recommend these headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I understand that the sound quality is not up to the mark for audiophiles. But if you do not own a BW or Paradigm reference speakers or $500 headphones, Bose will be a big leap for you in terms of sound.But what makes these headphones a joy to use is the noise cancellation. Its black magic. its that good! Everything sounds better, because you can hear it properly. Even at home, its a big help. Humming refigerators, rattling dishwashers, mixer blenders, all of it just disappears. Its awesome!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"absolutely NOTHING else compares to these headphones in the realm of sound cancelling ability. They are comfortable, sound great, work great, and only need one AAA batt to run for 30-40 hours of use."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have never like Bose as a company. I have had terrible customer service and I seem to run into proprietary design that does not allow me to do what I want. I hate Bose....And, I keep ending with their headphones because they hit a sweat spot for me. I had the QC3. They were slightly more comfortable than the QC15s and the sound seems comparable. The QC15s seem a little more cheaply made but the noise canceling is better.I am not an audiophile but I seem to like pretty good headphones. I also don't seem willing to go much over $300 for a set of headphones. I have found some that sound better for more but not good enough for my ears. In this price range I have found nothing that has the QC15s mix of good sound, good noise canceling and comfort and I tried quite a few.My daughter has the new Beats. They feel stouter but the sound is not as good nor is the noise canceling although the price is comparable. Of course these don't look as cool or so my daughter tells me. My wife has a comparably priced pair of Audi Technica (or Senhauser? - can't remember). Hers are a little more comfortable and seem stouter as well but again sound and noise canceling are not as good. I managed to try about 6 different headphones in this price range and the QC15s came out on top.I guess I am stuck with Bose for another few years and believe me I would much prefer another company."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Still not convinced these are worth what they cost - but they are very comfortable for wearing for long periods of time. Noise reduction seems to be par for other cheaper models -- but these are comfy.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm only giving 4 stars here because I don't think that these are anything extraordinary versus other $300 headphones. However, I do find them to be extremely comfortable, and playing music (even at very low volumes) is extremely effective at suppressing office chatter. I really like the fact that they come with both a regular cable for use with 1/8 stereo jack, as well as an Apple-specific cable which includes a mic and volume/pause controls. The carrying case is outstanding as well, it allows you to throw them in your backpack with no worries about damage. Battery life is pretty good, I use Eneloop and only replace the battery (with another rechargeable) every several days, after listening all day long in the office."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is my 2nd pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones. Here's what you should need to know.Noise cancelling - The Bose are the best noise-cancelling technology going today. But realize that noise cancelling means noises that are constant, like fans, engine noise and the usual din of modern life. While they will lessen the noise of a screaming baby, they won't cancel the baby out. But if someone wants to still talk to you, they can, without scaring you out of your wits.Sound quality - These headphones are audiophile quality. Now, before the golden eared snobs start up, realize this. Like most headphones, they only amplify what's put into them. Most people use these headphones with iPods or iPhones. That means mp3 files, which are inferior audio files to begin with, especially harsh  in the upper registers. Put a good DAC between these and the audio file and you have an audiophile experience that's great. Plenty of accurate bass, good mids and satisfactory treble. Comfort is the best of any headphone I've worn. Great sounding headphone are that great if your head isn't comfortable.Build quality - This is THE BIGGEST ISSUE with these headphones. They are fragile. I had a pair of QC2's. The plastic covering the headbands cracked and fell off a couple of year's after I bought them. I wrapped black electrical tape around the plastic and used them for another nine years. Was I disapponted? Yes. $300 headphones should last longer before breaking. Last week, I took them back to the Bose store and they offer a trade-in program. Is it the best deal? No, but it's better than nothing. What other company lets you trade in 11 year headphones and get new QC15s for $129? At least Bose admits to their product defect years after the warranty expired.People don't realize, when you like headphones, especially for noise reduction, the hours quickly add up. Taking them on and off, occasionally sitting on them, perspiration from sitting on your ears all day, all cause wear and tear.Unfortunately, Bose has improved on the headphone's flimsy quality, but not by much.Considering the dreck headphones and in-ear junk now sold for over $200, the Bose headphones represent a good value, but in a fragile package.If you're rough on things. or want to go jogging everyday with headphones on,, do not buy these headphones. If you use them for an occasional plane trip and the occasional bedtime music or audio book session, you'll be very pleased with these. Just put some money away in the bank for your next pair."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I writing this review as Bose longtime customer and recent victim of counterfeit Bose QC15 headphones purchased from non-authorized Bose seller - as warning for all users to avoid expensive imitations. I have recently purchased pair of Bose QC15 Limited Edition from reputable eBay seller for a premium price above the retail value of this model. Although item location was listed as in US, I got suspicious when tracking number was showing product being shipped from Hong Kong. Immediately after receiving product, despite of looking perfectly genuine as my other pair of QC15, I verified its serial number by contacting Bose US and Bose HK. They both confirmed that serial number is invalid which along with the fact it was shipped from HK made the pair I received  a possible counterfeit. One way or the other I the warranty card is not valid with invalid serial number, so make sure to purchase these only from Bose-authorized seller or directly through Amazon. Always log in to Bose and validate serial number to make sure you have genuine product you paid for."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is my second QC15.  My first was unfortunately lost on a previous trip to Europe.  This one is identical to the previous from what I can tell but the inclusion of the iPhone control is nice.  The control might be a little to close to the headset but it's not a real problem, just different from my other controls."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Great sound, great comfort and amazing noise-cancelling capabilities.  The attachments make it perfect for my new I-Pod and works as represented when on an airplane. I've bought numerous cheaper models (at a collective cost that exceeds this product) and have not been satisfied with any other headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are the most comfortable, most effective noise cancelling headphones, and the audio quality is amazing. Here's why I recommend them.1. I totally disagree with the negative comments about this not having enough bass. As I write this review I've been listening to One Republic's Counting Stars, Adele's Rolling In The Deep, and Lady Gaga's Telephone, all of which have lots of hard driving bass. They sound great--and my iPhone 4S volume is only at the half way point.The music sounds clean and crisp--no muddiness at all. Every instrument on my jazz and classical favorites is clearly articulated, and with no tinniness or excessive treble. Bose is known for a very mellow, smooth sound. If I close my eyes I feel like I'm at the Blue Note or Lincoln Center in Manhattan depending on the selection.Note: If you don't require noise cancellation and want headphones that are much less expensive and sound great, I recommend theJBL J55i High-Performance On-Ear Headphones with JBL Drivers, Rotatable Ear-Cups and Microphone - Black2. When I travel and just want to sleep, I turn on the White Noise app on my iPhone. With the Bose noise cancellation and that app it's like being in a cocoon. I don't hear any noise on a plane or the radio in the car.3. This comes with two sets of audio cords--one for Apple products and the other for non Apple products. The Apple product cord lets me easily control the volume on my iPhone 4S and also make and receive phone calls. When I called my wife she said my voice sounded nice and clear. No tunnel sound at all. And of course her voice was crystal clear because it was coming through these headphones.These run on a single AAA battery, which is included and is very economical.4. Bose customer service is amazing. I had a ten year old pair of Bose Quiet Comfort Q2 headphones where the earpieces had become ragged and part of the headset clip was taped where I had broken it. I also had no receipt. I brought them into the Bose store and asked about replacing the foam earpieces (which cost $35). The Bose salesperson said that for $129 I could trade in my old headphones and buy the brand new Q15 complete with a new warranty, which I did.So if you have any prior model of the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, go into a Bose store and you can upgrade (at least for now) to this latest model for $129.Bottom line: Bose products are not cheap, but you definitely get your money's worth. I love these headphones, and bought another pair on Amazon for a family member.Note:  I don't recommend using these at the beach or poolside because they are too hot to wear on a warm day. I use theBose SIE2 Sport Headphones - Green.I also don't recommend them for the gym--too bulky and not water resistant, so your sweat can zap them. For the gym, especially for running on the treadmill, I recommend theAvantree Jogger Pro Sweat Proof Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Stereo Headphones / Headsets with microphone for running / sports - Black/Grey."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Mainly use the headphones while traveling on airplanes. Does an excellent job of cancelling out the constant drone of the jet engines and the miscellaneous noises in the cabin. When used in conjunction with an ipod, almost all the noise is eliminated. However, if they announce that the plane is about the crash, you may not hear it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm flying 2-3x per month and this is hands down the best product I have bought in a long time! It cuts down the noise from the jet engines and crying babies by 60-80%. I used to get off the plane feeling fatigued from all the noise, but now I just turn them on and its very quiet! The quality of the sound from music & movies is very good (not exceptional), but a heck of a lot better than my sony headphones. I was very skeptical, but after using these on the last 10-15 flights I will never fly again without them!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"1) The product *stank* when it arrived. Not just the usual horrible BPA plastic smell, I'd have preferred that to this. Somehow Bose managed to use a plastic in the carrying case that made the product smell to me like it had come from a smoker's house. Awful. Not sure if they sent me reconditioned ones by mistake or what. I'm hoping it'll wear off over time.2) I'd have really liked a 3 position switch. Off, On, On + Noise Reduction.  As it is, it's noise reduction or nothing, which I can see the point of from the whole Bose purist thing, but for tech reasons I'd have liked to have had a way of comparing to see how much volume I'm not having to use to hear the music when the NR is kicked in. Either way, this is great. I work in an atmosphere with a *lot* of computer/heating/ac fan noise. I hadn't realized how much until I put these on then flick the ON switch. It's like someone flipped the 'mute' switch on the world. Wow.  I've had a lot of fun letting other people put these on, get used to the ambient room noise, then flip the switch and watch their mouth drop.Aside from the excellent sound repro, a huge plus point for me is that I can actually wear these for long periods. I must have a larger head than normal or something because other headphones I've tried eventually really hurt my head where the top crossbar presses down on the skull, no matter how much padding they include. These ones do not, they actually expand enough. 10/10 for that."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Recently purchased these for work, I did a lot of research and tested a lot of phones before deciding on these. The NC is not really essential for me as I don't work in a noisy environment. But I found it to be such a nice feature. The sound quality is of the best I have ever heard. I plugged my iPod into several phones at the store to do a side by side comparison, and these bad boys were so superior to everything else I tried. The only drawback is having to replace the batterie. I also do not like that you have to have the NC turned on to listen to music, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but it does increase sound quality. If you've got the clams you won't be disappointed with the Bose quiet comfort 15 headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Overall love these headphones; very happy with fit, sound, and battery life - which I'm averaging a 'month' of use at work with a solid 4-5 hours per day of use on non-rechargables. Minus half a star for no passive mode...these are headphones and shouldn't need a battery to operate, even if it's in non-NR mode."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am a frequent international traveler and fly over the Pacific very often. My ears are very sensitive with high pitches and whine, so I get quickly tired with background noise especially those ones from cheap headphones. And I am forced to unnecessarily raise the volume because conversation scenes can be frustrating at times with that kind of headphones on. Doing so is not only hassle but also not healthy to my ears. For that matter, these headphones perfectly filtered the natural noise of the airplane and I could enjoy the movie without constantly adjusting the volume. It cover your ears very comfortably as well. I highly recommend this to travelers like me.*This review was originally written for the older version, but since the only difference is the new cable with phone controls, I am writing here too for those who need an opinion from actual frequent flyer."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Voice quality is great, but as pointed out in other reviews, if it is just to listen to music, you may like other products based on the genre of music that you listen to.My reason for buying this product was for Air travel and Noise suppression. This being a key factor, I selected QC-15 over QC-3Engine noise suppression is the best in class.Interestingly, under normal operation, you can hear people speaking. This for me is a plus, if you are listening to music at home. But on the plane, thankfully it mutes out the sound  of crying children and lets you rest or sleep in peace.Overall, I got of the plane feeling rested and was able to deal with jet lag better. I take long flights (10 ~ 15 hour flights). The ears feel a bit sore initially if you use the headset for such a long time. But I think I will get adjusted to it with usage, and the fit is overall very comfortable.Also, I can listen to music or audio at lower volume levels on the flight, which is overall better for in the long run.The case is quite sturdy, and has some extra space. I have a Motorola S9-HD bluetooth headset that I also pack in the case to use when I hit the gym for workouts."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My first pair wore out after 10 years, and I hope these will last as long. I use them constantly, eight months a year, when I'm out in my garden working, with my iPod nano, so they get a serious workout. I also use them inside when my neighbor guns his 4-wheeler and dirt bikes a hundred feet from my house--they are the only thing that saves my sanity. I have one average ear and one that sticks out a bit, and these ear cups are deep enough that I can wear them for 4 hours comfortably. The headband is &#34;okay&#34; comfortable, not great, it could be better, but I don't know of any headphone that compares for fidelity and sound quality. I used it to rate my AudioTechnica ATH-M30's and was surprised how much more I heard with the Bose. If you live in a noisy environment and you crave quiet, I suggest you try these. They were great in my cubicle, too, before I retired. Got a lot more work done. Felt a bit self-conscious at first because they were so big, but that only lasted half a day. And I wouldn't think of flying without them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is definitely the craziest noise canceling I have ever heard....or didn't hear...wait. I'm confused now.I first tried these on in Best Buy. As soon as I placed them over my hears, all the store noise was gone. Didn't hear anything! Then I pressed play on the display and a nice crisp sound was coming through. Still having my hand on the display I felt the whole display shaking like an earthquake. I thought to myself 'what is going on'. Then the person speaking to me in the headphones asked me to take them off my head for a minute and surprize surprize! That whole time I felt the shaking a speaker that was right in front of my face was BLARING this really awfully loud noise and I didn't even know it! Insane!I work in a very noisy environment with a printer that sits right next to my cubicle that drives me absolutely insane. The air conditioner vent is also right above my cube which is also a nuisance. So I bit the bullet and bought these headphones.It blocks the printer noise and air conditioner noise out. It even blocks out the sound of me typing on my keyboard. It doesn't, however, block out people talking as much, but if you have music playing you definitely wont hear them.These headphones are VERY comfortable!I am a music producer/DJ and headphone fanatic so I own a lot of different headphones and these things I cant even tell I have on after wearing them for even an hour +.Some people complain about they make your ears hot and sweaty. I'm not a very sweaty person, and I own headphones that are a lot worse so I didn't notice that problem with these headphones as bad. A brief 5 second lift off every 30 minutes to an hour was good enough for me.The sound itself is very clean and crisp. I also tried on the Beatz by Dre at best buy and I though the BOSE were 10x more comfortable, better constructed, sound cleaner, and the noise cancelation isn't even a comparison. They might not have as much bass as the Beatz, but I don't like too much bass pumping directly into my ear drum.As I mentioned, I am a music producer and a DJ, so if anything, for personal listening I prefer to use less volume on my ears and save the ear punishment for when I am mixing. These headphones with the noise canceling allow me to keep the volume at a VERY low level and still hear the music as it was intended.All that being said, as much as I love these headphones I think I may have to return them. They are great for casual listening but aren't very useful in a studio recording / tracking situation. The sound is too colored (not flat). So the only use I can see these for is personal enjoyment in the office, which I can't justify the 300 price tag for.Also, I light to travel lightly. These headphones come with a very nice case, but I cannot see carrying this around with me everywhere I go. Feels almost like an old oversized portable Sony Discman case.The mandatory need for battery power provided or the headphones do not operate at all also isn't my style.I should also mention that these headphones DO bleed. Meaning, if someone was sitting near you and you had the volume turned up I'd say halfway, they will probably hear what you are listening to. Full volume and everyone will be jamming to your tunes. You usually won't have to turn them up high though with the noise canceling, but headphone bleed is a BIG no no for me. I don't like hearing other people's headphones so I wouldn't expect anyone to have to listen to mine.I'd say if I didn't already own a bazillion other headphones and the BOSE QuietComfort 15's offered a useful role in my recording studio other than blocking out the computer sound then I consider keeping them and if they didn't absolutely require battery power I would more than likely keep them. But 300 just for personal use to block out office noises that are fairly blocked out with the use of ear buds I cannot justify.Maybe if I run into an exuberant amount of cash flow in the future I may repurchase. Hopefully by then they will have a model that operates even without battery power.  =)"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Its a bit pricey but this headset is really high quality. The noise reduction is amazing. Immersive experience. I love it.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've used Bose QC headphones since they have been on the market, almost. My QC2s, around 5-6 years old, started to generate static when bumped. I called Bose and asked if there was a trade-up program, even though the warranty was expired. They said ""Yep - send the old ones in, and we will sell you a replacement set - now the QC-15, for around $125!!!  What a deal! Since I not registered the old ones with Bose - I could have found an old set at Goodwill, and gotten the same deal..... I'm not advocating doing that butThey sent the QC15s the same day, I got the 2 days later - long before they got my old ones!No idea why the ""best negative review"" is several years old. It states among other things, that these have no volume control. The certainly do! Along with a mute button if you're using them with iphones, and a track skip button. All on one single button device, about 6-8 inches down the cord from the headset.These provide even more noise cancellation than the old ones, which were already very good at this feature. They do not cancel out certain noises, like human voices, unless you are playing music. Music itself pretty much cancels out all external noise.A nice case is provided. Again, some reviews said the new case does not have a separate zippered compartment for spare batteries and airplane adapter. Again - not true. The case looks almost identical to my old one.Highly recommended - good quality, long life (in my case), and excellent customer service.The line is indeed thin. It may not last for years, but then again - my old one had no issue with the cords."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The Bose QC 15 is the first noise cancellation headphones I've tried out. After trying them out for couple of hours today, I was feeling uncomfortable with it. I read some articles regarding noise cancellation technology causing dizziness and nausea due to low frequency sounds causing sensitive inner ears to vibrate.Well, I'm going to return this headphones since they were causing discomfort."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Why I purchased:- Needed a new pair of headphones- I work in a rather noisy office and needed something that could provide active noise canceling- Had to have headphones that sit around the ear instead of directly on the earPros:- I've bought Bose products before so I knew I could expect great quality. Given that, I was still completely blown away with how comfortable these headphones are.- Very effective noise canceling- Sound quality is exactly what one would expect from Bose- Includes a nice case to keep them safeCons:- Not really a con, but just be aware that these headphones do require a AAA battery for the noise canceling. Be sure to keep a spare battery in your carrying case."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Required for trans-pacific flights. Quite happy with these.It is true that they are worthless when the battery is dead, but the battery life is decent."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've bought many headphones having to travel on long international flights several times a year. Anyone whose traveled by jet aircraft can attest to how the high pitched engine noise can affect you. If you don't understand this try a pair of Bose headphones during a long flight, the calm, quiet difference becomes major when it blocks out everything except the music or sheer silence. I feel so much more relaxed and better after a flight when I have my Bose. Movies and music really do sound that much better, I hear things I never heard before while wearing these head phones.I've owned some Sony noise canceling Headphones, some in the ear Costco lightweight phones, some Maxwell (Walmart $40) over the ear headphones as a comparison. At first I could not accept the concept that I had to spend $300 on headphones. What it comes down to is you're paying for quality and you'll note the volume of people on planes who also have paid the price and own Bose.The sound quality is one part, the materials stand out as they are the only head phones I can wear for 12 hours which don't hurt my head or ears. My ears don't sweat like the Maxwell's did, they block out far more noise than the Sony's and Costco's. When you switch on the noise reduction you instantly notice the difference. In fact the new QC15's listen to the volume of noise and adjustautomatically. I now can turn the volume down on my ipod and laptop when I play movies and music. It just sounds better and due to the great isolation you hear more."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The sound quality on these headphones is wonderful. I'd forgotten how nice real over the ear headphones could sound after years of using earbuds but these converted me back. The noise canceling features work well and really reduce the background noise on my commute (the BART trains of the SF Bay Area).My only complaint is the lack of support for Android phones as controllable music players. You have to use the plain cable with your Android phone or you won't even get stereo sound, also the controls don't work for the Android devices. I've tried it on a Samsung Galaxy SII, a Motorola Droid Mini, and a Google Nexus 7. Plug it into the iPhone 4S or 5S or a Mac Laptop and everything is perfect.  Bose doesn't advertise support for Android, but I really think they should. And before you think you can just find a third party cable - don't bother.  As of the time I write this there is only one, and it flips the L and R channels which really annoys some.Add full Android support and this becomes a five star review."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Dramatic title to this comment but maybe true. I am super noise sensitive. Thus I find these head phones are a god send if a god could ease the annoyance of loud neighbors and other noises. I have worn them to bed when I cannot sleep. The music play back through them is great. When I need to simply relax in life, I put them on and go into my quiet comfort zone. MORE than a pair of mere headphones. I wish I could enclose my house in them ;-)"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I don't use these much at home, but they really are wonderful on an airplane.  Flying is a much less miserable experience with my Bose headphones.  Even if there's a screaming baby 3 seats away, I simply pop these on and crank up the volume until the little monsters just sound like a faint, distant echo very far away."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have been looking for a good sent of noise canceling headphones. My son visits during his breaks from school and he likes to study in the room right off the TV room. I got him a cheaper set from Brookstone a while back, and although he liked them he said they didn't really work all that well. So, I got these based on the comments here.They really did the job. Although no headphones will really completely block off external sound, these come close. You simply put the battery on (one AA) and you put it on and immediately external noise is quieted. If you use the cord you can attach it to your computer or iPod  or phone and combined with the music, you won't hear anything outside of that headset.The music itself is is divine - the perfect balance of high and low. Plus and this is a huge plus for me, this is the most plush and comfortable headphones I've ever used. I can wear them for hours.Highly highly recommended. I am glad I got them. Just be sure to have an extra battery handy in case the one in the headphones wears out."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I purchased these after much debate and more than a few recommendations.  I am glad I finally pulled the trigger on them.  They make flying on a plane so much easier as all that engine noise just goes away.  Now these are not &#34;noise isolating&#34; so they won't really drown out voices since the cancellation algorithm doesn't see that as &#34;noise.&#34; Nut even so it will mute them a little bit so they aren't as noticeable.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these as Christmas gifts for my son and husband (and got one for me too). I can barely get them off my husband's head these days. He relaxes in his &#34;man chair&#34; with them and tunes out all the stress. My son travels for business, and he loves screening out plane noise. They feel great on the ears, and you really feel like you're in your own safe little world when you wear them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased a unit several months ago and recently purchased another pair, (no better unit).I mention a plane in my title only because in my research, the vast majority of people and manufacturers talk about noise canceling on a plane.  Do 99% of the people who use noise canceling headsets want them for planes?  Personally, I want them for the office, workouts at the gym while on a treadmill, and on a rare occasion while on a jet, not that I go on one all that often, hardly ever.That being said, I was able to test on a business trip last November to Europe, so I can comment on it.  (My own personal comment is who cares.  If you travel every day, okay, but once or twice a year, is it worth commenting on?)Notes* Noise Canceling: I do not mean to be picky, but I have not tried any headset, and I tried quite a few, which are ""noise canceling"".  Headsets, these included, are ""Noise Reducing"".Airplane / Jet* With all the talk of airplanes (jets, really), I honestly thought that I would not be able to hear the engine that I would be as if I were in a quiet concert hall.  That thought was a complete fantasy.  Yes, the surrounding noise of the jets were quieted down, allowing me to hear the video, but I definitely heard the jets and the background noise.  I will not give a percentage.* I traveled on Air France, so this comment may not apply to other air craft carriers, but the sound level was either off or loud.  I could not adjust the volume to medium.  The quietest level before silence was quite loud.Gym* The same comment applies to the gym while running on a treadmil with other treadmills and bycles in the nearby area.  The background noise was quieter, but definitely there.* While on a treadmil, there is a definite thump-thump-thump on every up and down motion.  That seems to be an artifact of the noise canceling dealing with motion.General* The majority of the noise reduction is from the foam ear coverings.  The electronics adds to that.Office* Someone needs to come up with a headset that blocks out other people talking, doors opening and closing, and most importantly fans.  I work in an area, where there are lots and lots of noise fans for electronics (computers, etc.).  I so totally still here them, but at least the noise is reduced.  Talking is a bit duller, but only because of the foam.Sound Quality* I cannot really comment on that, as I an not an expert.  Music sounds okay, but hard to judge, as I still hear fans, and all sorts of other noise.I am giving a 3, but..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The more I buy/use Bose products, the more impressed I am. Noise cancellation is phenominal; you can't even hear yourself breathing. Combined with the standard Bose sound quality, listening to music is all the more amazing. It's true that you'll hear things you've never heard before in music you've heard several times before. Well worth the money."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I finally took the plunge with Bose and got these for my girlfriend.  She loves technology but isn't necessarily tech savvy, so I wanted something that had a good background of quality and comfort.  Trying these on myself, I can say that on those two fronts the QC15s are great.  We took this with us on a recent trip to Paris and had them on for hours so I can safely say that they are quite comfy.  The sound reproduction is also fantastic.  They aren't the most bass heavy of headphones, so if you do listen to a lot of low-end-heavy music, there are perhaps better options (Monster and Klipsch come to mind).  But for the majority of music and movies, the sound you get out of them is full and consistent over its frequency range.  You do get the feeling that the QC15 has been worked on and tuned to merit the somewhat hefty price tag.Of course, the major selling point with these particular headphones is the noise cancelling.  Like is stated elsewhere, you only get sound out of them if the noise cancelling is turned on.  Turn it off, the headphones do nothing.  When turned on, the noise that gets cancelled is what most would call &#34;ambient noise&#34;.  The general drone of the world around you.  Think, the sound a plane makes when inside it.  Speech isn't cancelled as aggressively, so you'll still take notice when someone starts talking to you.  I'd say this is more of a good thing actually, as you can wear them when around other people and still respond to them.If you've never used a pair of noise cancelling headphones, then don't expect the ambient sound to just vanish.  Instead of cancelling, think of it as lessening.  It's there but is drowned down to the point where the music or whatever you're listening to is no longer impaired by it.  Think something akin to how earbud headphones work.  When you pause your music with earbuds on, you can still heard the world, but turn the music back on and it is no longer audible.I can't speak to the battery life yet as the original batteries haven't died yet.  That being said, thus far they've lasted for many hours (10+).The general build of the headphones is solid.  The battery compartment has a door that swings open but stays connected to the set, so that's nice.  You don't notice its there when it's closed, and in fact it was a little hard to find when I initially got them.  The 3.5mm cable unplugs from the set and can be stored separately, which is a nice touch.  Don't worry though, the connection doesn't feel loose so you aren't in danger of it coming unplugged accidentally.  You also get an extra iPod cable, with music controls and an plane adapter.Overall, the QC15 are a great pair of headphones but only if you need or want the noise cancelling, since they don't work unless you turn it on.  For travel, there's really nothing better.  Combine the quality, comfort, and noise cancelling and it's almost a must have."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Bought it as a gift for my brother! He fell in love with it. Could not believe what great sound it has as well as the noise cancelling feature that is ideal for his travels and love for music. Great gift!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'll admit, like others, I had reservations about dropping $300+ on a pair of headphones... These things are unreal! Build quality is impeccable, sound quality is great, and noise cancelling FAR surpasses expectations. These are not your $50 noise cancelling headphones. If you've tried the cheapo versions in the past and aren't sold on the technology, seriously try the QC-15's! There is no comparison... The range of destructive frequencies is much larger, and unlike the cheaper versions, these headphones have sampling mics both on the outside and inside. The result is absolutely incredibly noise reduction, even with high-frequency noise, which is something the cheaper versions fail to suppress well.I am seriously in love with these things. My only complaint is the inability to listen to music unless the noise reduction mode is on. Luckily however, these headphones use a single AAA battery, which is very easy and convenient to replace."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Definitely worth the extra $$$. I was hesitant, as I've owned about three other brands of noise canceling headphones, but none compare to these. Great for the airplane at drowning out the plane engines, A/C and passenger side conversations!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Pretty good headset.  I use them on my computer and they are quite a bit louder than my other ($50 headphones).  This is nice, the sound cancelling isn't anywhere near as effective as I expected.  They basically remove a lot of the ambient noise but you'll still hear even relatively quiet sounds happening around you.  I also use this set as a headset while flying with an adapter and the noise cancelling doesn't do much, though they are very light and comfortable.I'm glad I purchased them, use them daily and would definitely recommend."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,One of the best noise cancellation headphones I've ever had in my entire life! Awesome quality and really pure rich sound with no one bothering you around while you watch movies or music best for sleep! I recommend this product buy it now before it's too late! A+++
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought this pair to replace my old, below fifty bucks, Koss on which I usually play random music to drown out background chatter. On the upside, the QC2's noise cancellation is superb. However, the sound quality is no better than the Koss, and may be even be worse in many cases.What bothered me more is that I have to manually turn on the noise cancellation, and it is *not* optional, in case I just want to listen to music or news without burning the batteries. This proved to be a big annoyance: I use headphones 6-8 hours a day at my desk, but need noise cancellation may be for an hour max in the whole day. Why on earth should I then need to burn batteries in the phone for all the 8 hours rather than 1??? It makes no sense to me ...Sent it back. Bose should re-think this product. At any rate, the noise cancellation and ordinary use needs to be decoupled. Simple sound production should be possible without turning on noise cancellation. Even when noise cancellation is turned on, the default power source should be the cord, if plugged in. The battery should be needed *only* when the headphone is being used only for noise cancellation without the cord on."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Things I wish I knew before these were in my hands.1. Without the battery and noise canceling turned on, these don't do anything. I expected with it off that they'd still be great headphones, just no noise canceling. Nope. They have to be turned on to do anything.2. I purchased these because I wanted the person next to me not to be annoyed by hearing the music I am. I tried on a pair of Sony 7510 and I expect the HD 280 pro (the other recommendation I got) would do this better for less $.The sound quality is great and the headphone quality I expect to last quite a while as per my experience with my other Bose product."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'll save the long winded review for the rest of the reviewers, but I'll say that of all the other noise cancelling headphones I've used, these are by far the best.  Some others may produce slightly superior sound quality, but none yet have managed to match Bose's noise cancelling abilities.  On a plane, the sound just melts away when they're turned on.  Even when I'm not listening to music, I still have these on with the headphone jack unplugged to tune out all the ambient engine noise.  With music on, there could be a gunfight 10 feet away and you wouldn't hear it.Passive noise isolation VS active noise cancellation:  Passive isolation of noise would be like using earplugs or other hearing protection.  Sound is reduced by physically blocking the sound waves from entering your ear by means of a physical barrier.  Actively cancelling the noise is done by creating sound waves that are 180 degrees out of phase with the lower frequency noise that is intended to be reduced, effectively ""erasing"" the sound as far as your ears are concerned.  All headphones have the former to a certain extent.  The more expensiveBose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphonesare ON EAR and are Bose's ""Told Ya We Could Do It"" answer by massively reducing ambient noise using primarily noise cancellation with minimal isolation.  The QC15s use BOTH, as they are OVER THE EAR so not only do they cancel noise electronically, they isolate it mechanically.  I've used both (a friend who seeks comfort in knowing he has the most expensive thing available has the QC3s) and I'm happy to report the 15s produce superior noise cancelling and, as a result, better sound quality.Battery life is phenomenal, I'm yet to replace them and have taken multiple international flights.  The substantial molded ballistic zipper case (not unlike the zipper cases that Oakley makes) is GREAT, and has a zipper pocket inside for spare batteries.  It also includes ""information cards"" about the headphones because Bose apparently hopes that your desire to brag about your expensive headphones will afford them free advertising.  Mine took a one way trip to the circular file and were replaced with my own business card, although I'm assuming if someone stumbles upon some lose Bose headphones it's pretty unlikely they won't declare Finders Keepers on them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these and the audio technica ones. The noise-cancelling is about 99% the same- but the comfort is why i stuck with the bose.  If you travel not that often- the audio technica ones are fine, but if you travel more, or have a large head like me. then go for the bose.cases and accessories are legit exactly the same."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Price: hands-down, these are excessively priced.Audio quality: Very good, but not excellent for the price. If you care more about audio quality, look elsewhere.Noise cancellation: Works very well, especially for repeated / prolonged noises such as A/C, refrigerator, engine noises. Not very effective on people chatting, especially when there is no sound/music.One important issue is how it feels without any sound source, i.e. turned on but with nothing being played. Noise canceling creates this feeling of 'air pressure' on the ear that does not feel like being in a quiet room. Colleagues using the same product reported some headache if used only in this way. It certainly does not feel natural.I have used a colleague's Logitech headphones (for a much shorter time) and they seemed to have similar noise cancellation abilities. Those were priced similarly though.Comfort: pretty comfortable. Completely covers my ears, not heavy at all. Padding is soft and pleasant.Other aspects: cord is long enough, not very long though. On/off switch makes an unpleasant sound when switched on."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these to use in a distracting open office environment, and they are EXCELLENT.  If you turn on noise-cancelling and don't play music, you'll definitely hear the voices around you, but once you play music at even a low volume level, most noise around you is simply non-existent.  In addition, the sound quality is really fantastic.  Great balanced sound and I'm constantly rediscovering music that I've loved for years.  You just hear so much more than with typical headphones and speakers.  Yes, the price is steep, but let me tell you...well worth it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought Bose's Noise Cancelling Headphones a few weeks ago at the airport on my way to Switzerland and it definitely made the trip more bearable. It was also nice to not have to increase the volume to harmful levels when watching movies. When you put them on, you immediately notice a significant reduction in ambient noise but once you turn it on, the reduction in noise is pretty radical. It almost feels like you're under water. You really have to experience it to see what it's like. You can still somewhat hear conversations/other noises around you but any type of repetitive background noise is almost completely gone."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are truly amazing headphones.  My hearing is not the best and I have trouble listening to movies on airplanes on my iPad, even with the volume up all the way.  The constant sound of the plane combined with the fairly low sound output of an iPad even at full volume rendered my inexpensive headphones ineffective on my last cross-country plane trip, much to my dismay.  These Bose QC 15s are the answer.  Their outstanding attribute is the noise cancelling feature.  It is quite literally astounding.  When noise cancelling headphones first came out a few decades ago I thought that it was mostly a gimmick.  (I can remember when scientists said that true noise cancelling was impossible to achieve.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote a short story on that subject, believe it or not.)  Well, hearing is believing.  One can sit in a noisy room and flick these headphones on and off and hear how the noise cancelling feature simply eliminates the background sounds.  I picked the QC 15  because it is the over-the-ear model and I wanted and need (for trips) the maximum amount of sound elimination.  But it is the noise cancelling electronics in the headphone, not the physical ear muff, that gets rid of most of the background noise.Sound reproduction fidelity with these headphones is outstanding; what you would expect from Bose.  It sounds like you are in the presence of the true sounds, not listening with headphones.  These headphones make watching/listening to movies on an iPad or Kindle Fire a real pleasure.  For airplane trips, for me at least, they are absolutely essential.I also selected the QC 15 model because it uses a AAA battery for power.  These batteries are easy to find and carry, and I did not want to have to hassle with recharging the headphones.  This is not practical on plane flights.  I just keep a couple of extra AAA batteries in the Bose case that comes with these headphones and I am good to go for an entire trip.Pretty much everything about these headphones is exemplary.  The really outstanding feature is the noise cancelling performance of these headphones.  If this attribute is important to you, these Bose headphones are the ones to get.  This is not important to all users, but on a plane it is an essential feature to me; otherwise I simply cannot hear the movie adequately.Highly recommended without reservation.  RJB."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've been using QC3's for a few years now, they've always been my trusted head phones for flights - lots of them The downside was the cable needed replacement every year or so and the ear pads every couple of years - not a big deal to me. Finally, the left ear phone lost connection, I could wiggle the cable to get it back but not get it to stick.  Came home into DCA the first flight this happened and bought a pair of Parrot ZiKs. Incredible sound but they're super heavy.  The top of my head hurt after an hour or so. Decided to try the QC15. So for, so good but haven't been on a long flight with them yet. I like that they use off the shelf batteries. they feel light. Not sure about the rest yet. Will update as I get more time in the air but so far, I like them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have owned many NR headset and this is my 4th Bose QuietComfort. I've owned all the previous versions and do like these the best. It does an amazing job, especially on a plane where the background noise production is amazing. The sound quality is amazing too.Pros:-Excellent Noise Reduction-Excellent Sound-Very comfortable-The single battery lasts a very long time (many months with regular use)Cons:-My major complaint is padding. They use a cheap heat seal that will break with time. Every Bose QuietComfort headset I have owned has this seal wear out and the sponge padding becomes exposed. For such an expensive headset you would expect a much better quality ear padding that would last. This is my only real disappointment with these but it is very significant because it has happened with every pair so it's not just a matter of one having a flaw.-You cannot use the headset without turning on the NR function. If your battery dies and you do not have a backup the headset cannot be used. Its not only that the NR will not work of course, there is no sound at all without the unit turned on"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Just awesome performance . I have other Bose products in my house and would never consider any other product. These headphones are  very comfortable and silence  95 per cent of background noise.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have had several pairs of higher end headphones meaning Sennheiser, Beats, other Bose models. But when I put these on I was transformed to a whole different word. I got lost into the crispness of songs that I never heard before. The added benefit was there was nothing on the outside that I could hear to take my attention away from the music. My search for the right headphone set has come to an end. LOVE these!!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought this twice and had to return it twice, but I still like it.The first time I got it, the seams on the case's zipper was coming off.  Since this is a product where you want to use the case on the daily basis, I decided to return it for a replacement as soon as I got it.The second time I got it, I used it for a week on various conditions (office, light rail train, and regular train (CalTrain)).  It's really the best noise cancelling headphone, and works well with both trains.  The reason I returned it the second time was that voice cancelling in the office was not good enough and I didn't want to spend too much money on a pair of headphone that doesn't cover that.  I have at least 5 co workers that use them in the daily basis and it was good enough for them since they listen to music with it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The headphones got the best noise cancelling around, not good, not better, but the BEST and I'll give it that! However, I was shocked at the face that you CANNOT play ANY audio with the NC feature off. Yup! it's either on or you'll hear nothing!Never mind! After 8 hours of constant audio playing with NC feature on I started feeling dizziness, nuance, discomfort! So much for a headphones that is branded as ""QuiteComfort"" eh? wasn't the headphones designed for long distance traveling, they should've prevented these side effects! and in order to use it daily, you have to change AAA batteries, or charge it if it's made out of lithium!finally, I bought the headphones to use it everyday and turn on the NC when traveling! Just why can't I play with the noise cancelling feature off? d*** move bose, D*** MOVE!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel frequently by air and had been wanting to try these for some time. Received this as a gift right before a long international trip, and these lived up to the high ratings and my high expectations. As straight headphones, they're quite comfortable and I had no problem wearing them for extended periods on the plane. The sound from music and movies is SO much better than earbuds ay any price, I was amazed at the clarity. Noise cancellation was very good as long as your not expecting total silence. They did an exellent job at eliminating most of the background noise in the airplane. I was surprised by the battery life. I wore these constantly on flights from the US to Hong Kong, to Bangkok, to India, to the UK and back to the US, and one battery lasted the entire trip. THese are pricey but for me they're worth it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,If you want awesome headphones you can get better sound quality at half the cost of these Bose.  They really shine with noise cancelling.  Definitely worth the money IMO.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased the Bose QC15 headphones primarily for use during long, intercontinental flights. They are wonderful. Plug them into your computer, smartphone, Ipod , the plane's headphone outlet or what have you, click on some music and kick back for the next 9 hours or so. These headphones really do silence out the din of the other passengers, as well as the droning of the aircraft engines and that air circulation hiss, while allowing you to be aware that your travel companion or the flight attendant is speaking to you. Thing is, you cannot clearly make out what they are saying, so if you want, you can just pretend you do not hear and go blissfully on listening to whatever. In researching these, I came across reviews that questioned the sonic fidelity, etc of these headphones. I am not a recording engineer or headphone guru, but these headphones sound perfectly fine to me. Frankly, I doubt that I could hear some of the things that the critics write about anyway. Besides which, I did not buy these headphones to sit in my  living room to listen to the 160 microphone, latest digital technology recording of a symphony orchestra or the thumping bass laden gangster rap recording of the latest MC Whoever. I bought them to provide me an envelope of relative quiet while flying on airliners, and that they do very well. My one complaint would be the fact that you cannot use the headphones as just regular headphones in the event that your batteries go dead. If the battery goes dead, then the headphones are dead. Luckily, the batteries are just generic AAA's, nothing exotic, built-in or proprietary. My solution, stick an extra set of batteries in the carrying case. Problem sort of solved."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm easily annoyed by the wrong kind of sound. The major reason I bought these was the toddler living in the condo above mine. She runs back and forth and back and forth, and it had become one of those straw/camel's back things that was truly making me crazy.I wondered if this noise-cancelling technology would work on that sort of noise. From what I'd read, I didn't have high hopes that it could help block structure-borne noise, which is almost equally perceptible as felt-vibration as it is heard-sound (if that makes sense). That was one reason I put off spending the $300 on these -- thinking they wouldn't work on the sound that bugged me most.Now I wish I'd bought them years ago. They're pricey AND they're worth every stinking penny. No, I can't say they always entirely block out that particular stomping/running noise, but they DO muffle it to a point where I'm hardly aware of it, which is a miracle. And that's with no music... just the noise-canceling turned on. (Yet when someone is speaking directly to me, I can hear, no problem.) When listening to music, I'm not aware of any sound coming from upstairs.I adore these headphones. They're comfortable enough that I can wear them for hours with really no discomfort... a slight sense of relief when first removing them, but the tradeoff in being able to blot out so much noise is way more than worth it. I expect that they're even going to improve my blood pressure. Part of me wants to send the bill for these to my neighbors, but I'm so much less apt to get irritable now, I don't even care that much anymore."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"We tried a friends other brand and these were by far more comfortable and quieter.I had to go to the hospital for one night, and they made the stay so much better.No rattling of trays, odd conversations or bangs to wake me up.It's great to be connected with my iphone at all times."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Great headphones with good noise cancellation. I started getting pain in my ear due the noise cancellation. I am not sure if the noise cancellation is worth the pain.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Some of the reviews I read had indicated that these headphones seemed flimsy or less durable than they should be, so I was a bit worried.  I knew there was a warranty period and used my Amex card so I had doubled that period and gave them a try.  However, there is nothing to worry about.  They are lightweight, but I would not say flimsy or cheap.  I do keep them in the great case that they come in, and I am not rough on them, but they show no sign of wearing out anytime soon.The sound isolation (the part that covers your ears and seals out external noise) is great, and the set is very comfortable.  The padding does not bunch up and breathes a bit, so your ears do not sweat as with cheaper designs.The noise canceling (the electronics that actually cancel out other sounds) is amazing.  If you are an audiophile and trying to hear every time the oboe player sniffles, you may be disappointed, but if you want to enjoy music or other audio while on an airplane without damage to your ears, these are for you. I had given up listening to my iPod on airplanes when I realized how loud the volume had to be to hear anything.  I could only imagine the damage I was doing to my ears.  Just try listening to the same volume level that was fine during the flight once you get home and you will know what I mean. With the Bose QC headphones, I can relax and listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks and the time just flies by.I am very pleased with my purchase."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"There is a certain 'lightness' in the sound quality of these headphones, particularly noticeable in the treble range - guitar strums are more apparent, cymbals are more sharper, spoken words are more vivid especially for tracks that you frequent, you hear sounds and tones you wouldn't normally notice. The bass range is set about right, not too heavy but not light either. Quite frankly, if all your music is in this lower range, you'd probably won't need these. To describe my sound experience in a few words, it is as if you are suddenly listening to the tracks you frequent with more sources/channels; in classical music, I am able to isolate (for those who can play by ear) and follow the musical instruments much easier whenever I choose. The sound canceling is aggressive, and I would be interested to try other devices out there that match or exceed this.For headphones that come with noise canceling, very few come close to the QC15, and at the end of the day, if you can afford these and noise canceling is part of your checklist, by all means go ahead as you will not regret it - these headphone do deliver at the price range they are set at.Put simply, the sound quality can be easily judged if you find you are going through all your music collection to listen to them again. And for many tracks you'll hear the difference."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Overall there are a LOT better headphones out there in terms of musical performance. I have used dozens and these are just above the middle of the pack. That is not considering the noise cancellation however.The noise cancellation during airplane travel is pretty good, but I certainly was not blown away. Again, the performance is above average but not &#34;startling good&#34;. On a very good note, my last trip was a long one and I watched two full movies in relative comfort, only had the &#34;I have to scratch my ear&#34; sensation once or twice in several hours.Overall I would have given these a 3.5 out of 5 if halfsies were allowed. I won't return them and will make them part of my travel kit for sure, but for the price I was slightly let down."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have had the Sony MDR-NC6 noise canceling headphones for a couple of years now. The sound on those was 75% and the noise canceling 60%, so for the daily use they were OK, but since I started wearing them for longer periods of time, the pressure to my ears started to make then hurt. So I decided I would get a replacement that would do great in all fronts. I ended up with 2 finalists, the Beats and the Bose, both noise canceling versions. I finally decided to go with the Bose because of more consistent build quality and neutrally optimized sound as opposed to base sound optimization of the Beats. For the Bose, the noise canceling on this model is even better than its predecessor so excellent I would rate it 92% sound quality is very good, I would say 85%. The downside of these headphones is that they require the on switch not only to cancel noise but even to play music. In other words if you run out of battery, they are USELESS. So plan for a charger and at least a couple of rechargeable AAA batteries..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have had a pair of SONY, a pair  of Sennheiser and a pair of Philips headphones, all with active noise cancellation.  Although all three were good for regular listening (Sennheiser the best) , their noise reduction systems were inadequate for air travel, for which I bought them in the first place.  I have a strong bias against Bose in general as I find their products mediocre at best, and almost comically overpriced.  But after trying a pair of QC15s I reluctantly concluded that the noise cancelling system of the QC15s  is far, far superior to any other active NC headphones that I have tried, and that is why I now have a pair.  I use them for traveling exclusively.  With the QC15s it is actually possible to enjoy the music while traveling,  something not possible with my earlier mentioned headphones.  For regular home listening, as is typical with any Bose product, much better performance can be had for a fraction of the price.  The QC15,s have a hard upper mid/lower treble range, some EQ is required to avoid fatigue.  My Beyer  DT235,s (no NC) are clearly superior and cost $50.00!  BUT when traveling by air, the QC15,s are an absolute blessing, way superior to any other headphones, and for that specific purpose I wouldn't trade them for anything."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love these headphones!  I had narrowed my choices down to these and the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC9, and ultimately picked the Bose because they really were more comfortable, at least for me.  The ANC9s felt like they were applying too much pressure to my head. But it could also be that I have a larger than average head.  I thought about just bending the frame of the ANC9s out a bit, but didn't want to risk being able to return them.  So instead I opted to exchange them for the QC15s which I already knew would feel comfortable since I was able to try a demo pair in Best Buy.The noise-cancelling works very well in my office environment.  We have an air conditioner that makes a constant loud hum that can be very annoying after working all day.  These block that out completely, yet I can still hear my cell phone ring, so it does let some higher frequencies through, which is good.One thing I did like about the ANC9s is that they would work as regular headphones if there was no battery installed.  They wouldn't do active noise reduction without a battery, but you could still hear your music. With the QC15s, when the power stops, so does your music.  But I'm okay with that because I bought these specifically for the active noise reduction feature, so I do plan to have a battery in them at all times.  If I didn't want that feature then I would have just opted for a cheaper pair.I do like that carrying case these come with. It's not too large since they earpieces fold flat.  It has some room to store some extra batteries, and a fabric loop to hook onto your luggage when traveling.  I'm anxious to try these on my next commercial flight.I actually wanted the ANC9s to work out for me, since I thought they sounded good and were $100 cheaper at Best Buy.  But since I do plan to wear them for several hours each day, I went for the comfort.  I've tried various earbuds and on-the-ear headphones, but couldn't go more than an hour or two.  These fit completely around the ear, so all of the pressure is on your skill, (and I apparently have a thick one).  I can wear these all day, and I often do.Highly recommended!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Yes, I agree it is not apple to apple comparison. Compared QC 15 with Audio-Technica ATH-M50Build Quality:1) Audio Technica- Solid construction and very durable2) Bose- You pay $300 for an incredibly cheaply made.Size:1) Bose- They fit really well2) Audio-Technica- mid-sized.Comfort:1) Bose- Very comfortable. I did not experience too much discomfort.2) Audio-Technica- Exceeded my satisfaction though I felt more warmer on my ears compared to BoseSound:1) Audio-Technica- Mind blowing. Just beat the hell out of Bose. What a range!!2) Bose- Great sound, but missed highs and lows. For $300, I expected more.Noise cancellation:1) Audio-Technica- None available2) Bose- Excellent. Hardly hear anything other than people who are too loud.Overall, I love ATH-M50 more than QC 15. It is my feeling about the product."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are my primary air travel headphones, and let's just say they are great.  I use to wear in-ear earbuds to block out noise but after a couple of hours they felt like earwigs crawling into my ears, so enough was enough and I bought the Bose:The reason why I love these?1. The ultra soft leather on the cups doesn't push the arms on your glasses (if you wear glasses) into your brain while you are wearing these.  Some other headphones will do this, it seems Bose might have thought about this, especially for people who will wear these hours at a time.2. The iPod/iPad/iPhone volume control is actually useful, when the flight attendant comes along all you need is a simple push of the button and everything pauses so you can talk to her.3. Nice little pouch inside the case is perfect to store an extra battery in case you run out.4. They are comfortable to wear hours at a time.Everything about these headphones is premium, they feel much nicer than other noise-cancelling headsets I have tried. The sound is very balanced and warm, and by that I mean don't expect thundering bass or ear-cringing treble, everything seems to be in the right proportion and ""tight"".Some negatives?  The case is big, if you're travelling with only an overnighter bag, you'll have to be creative finding room for the case.  Keep in mind that the case does have a loop on top, so theoretically you could tie a sort of lanyard around the loop and wear the case around your neck while boarding.  Sure, little children will mock you and throw pacifiers at you if they see you wearing that thing around your neck, but take comfort in the fact that you'll be able to drown out their shrill little screams once you are on the plane, smiling at the thought that their parents are cursing you for finding noise-blocking peace."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,After owning one for about a year the plastic deformed enough that you cannot get the AAA battery out making it useless.  This is the second Bose product that I have bought that suffered from poor engineering.  Pretty much not buying from them anymore.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These things are awesome, I would have given them five stars except for one negative that is a real bummer, since I wanted these for the office: They leak too much sound!  I wanted closed headphones so I would not disturb my cubicle neighbors, and I have some Sennheiser studio headphones that are AWESOME as far as having very little sound leakage, but they don't sound as good to the user as these do!  I think I will need to keep the volume down, which is hard to do because they sound so good!  If you want them for home, traveling on airplanes, etc., they are perfect, albeit pricey."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is a review after 3 years of pretty constant use, including air travel, car travel, and just listening in my study.-The best part of these headphones is 100% the noise cancellation. It works wonders when traveling by air or car. This makes it easy to fall asleep in both situations. Ive had Audio Technicas and a cheap pair of Sony noise cancellation headphones before and both were nothing compared to these wonders. The noise cancellation works both ways too so even if you have the volume up, the person sitting next to you wont hear a thing. Its pretty amazing to take them off after a while and the amount of noise sounds like a blast compared to the sanctuary you were just experiencing.-The sound quality for the first 2 years is pretty amazing. It is very crisp and all frequencies are represented quite well. The bass could be more influenced, but thats what equalizers are for. Most individual instruments were distinguishable. This is in stark contrast to the Audio Technicas I had before.I am writing this review now because the sound quality has finally given out. It is immediately noticeable that the speakers have given out to wear and tear when compared to a brand new pair. The lower bass tones are almost completely gone.  For how much I've used them though, this seems reasonable. However, $300 is a LOT to plop down on a set of headphones any day.-The leather ear pads and head band are pretty durable, but are finally collapsing after 3 years of use. However, they are fairly easily replaceable. These are probably the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. They are very lightweight, its fairly easy to sleep with them on, and the ear pads feel like two baby kittens are sitting on your ears. Its quite nice. The carrying case is really good so if you keep them in it there should not be any problem with the plastic on the ear cups.-I originally had a gold-plated 2.5mm headphone jack, but it got sucked up by a vacuum and now I have a silver-plated one. I wouldnt say the difference is incredibly noticeable unless you are really into the high frequencies for some reason.-One major downside compared to other $300+ headphones is the lack of a rechargeable battery. It gets pretty annoying having to buy AAA batteries all the time. Each AAA battery only lasts about 10 hours so if you really listen to music a lot, you'll be buying AAAs each week.-These are not audiophile headphones, but they are for every person that travels and listens to music for purely pleasure and doesn't criticize it too much.- 4 stars because Im buying a different pair of headphones now that these have finally given out."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love how they did NOT hard wire the cord into the headphones. I did not realize I'd belted the cord into my airplane seat so somehow I managed to pull the cord out of the headphones. Much better than stressing it. Love how they nearly eliminate airplane noise but I was disappointed how vocal frequencies were easily discernible yet not intelligible. So, true noise is virtually eliminated but not all sound as I would prefer."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've owned two other sets of noise cancelling headphones before this, JVC and Sony. Overall I was happy with them. I left the JVC's on a plane 5 years ago, and broke the Sony's recently by being in a hurry. So, without too much hesitation I ordered a pair of QC-15's. I fly weekly and they seem to be ubiquitous among frequent fliers, as 7 times out of 10 if a person's wearing headphones on a plane they're QC-15's.I was in for a big surprise.  From the instant I put them on, and listened to the first track I sensed something big was missing.There was bass and treble, but I felt the mid-range sounded thin, hollow, lifeless. I listened to a dozen or so tracks from my iTunes library and felt the same on each. A food analogy - Imagine cutting open a melon and finding all the meat was scooped out, leaving just the bit before the rind.The QC-15's made my ears sweat from the second I put them on for some reason.I did a little more research and read a number of reviews on Amazon and on other audio websites. For the same price, I purchased a set of Polk Audio ULTRA FOCUS 8000 On-Ear Headphones. The difference is night and day! They're probably the best headphones I've owned. With these I hear fine nuances never before heard on every single track! They're well balanced with sufficient bass and treble and a big FAT mid-range.http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-ULTRA-FOCUS-8000/dp/B0080OHGZA/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1370724270&sr;=8-1-fkmr1&keywords;=polk+audio+ultrafit+8000The QC-15's do have better noise cancelling, but in the end I felt like I had a $300 pair of NC headphones with the sound of a $15 set of department store phones (worse maybe). The sound quality of the Polk's is far superior even if more external noise does get through. Note the Polk 'on-ear' term is misleading, as they actually surround the ear.I always say if I'm going to be a lemming, I want to know where I'm going and why. I was a bit of a lemming when I purchased the QC-15's. Don't be a lemming and settle for very sub-par $300 headphones when far superior sound quality is available at a similar price. If noise cancelling trumps all, then the QC-15's may be what you want, but if what you hear is more important than what you don't hear, check out other brands, including the Polk Audio 8000's."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I travel on a plane for work quite often.  I put these headphones on and leave them on even if I am not listening to music.  They are amazing.  The only thing I don't like is sleeping with these on.  If you lean the headphones against the seat or window on the plane they make a strange buzzing sound.  Otherwise they are great.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I was looking for a pair of headphones that provided superior noise cancellation, so that I could eat out at some of the restaurants at the local Galleria mall, where the clientele are busy and noisily chatting, making it hard to hear anything. These Bose headphones provide a comfortable easy fitting solution. They provide an amazing noise cancellation (so much so, that you won't be able to hear your waiter unless you take them off), with almost no bleeding of sound to disturb those around when you find yourself in quietier settings (at work, for example). The noise cancellation requires two AA batteries inserted into the left earphone, which you then switch on to initiate noise cancellation. In the other earphone, a connector plugs in, which enables you to listen to another device. It comes with two connectors, one for standard devices, and another which is specifically tailored to Apple products, and plugs into iPhones, iPads, iPods. The great feature of the Apple connector is that it comes with volume control switches, which essentially take over the volume control, enabling you more freedom. I was particularly pleased that it enables you to answer phone calls on your iPhone without worrying about the noisy surroundings in a restaurant or mall or stadium, a big advantage as far as I'm concerned. The main drawback is the cost, about $300. But I feel that for my purposes, it was money well spent.I must add that I haven't tried any of the other noise cancellation brands.PROS--Comfortable around the ears, easily stored in car compartment, easy to operate, light weight, special Apple connector for iPod/iPhone, outstanding noise cancellation, almost no bleeding of sound.CON--Cost.Strongly recommended."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I have tried a number of headphones from top brands and all of them are lying idle in my cupboard as most of them are unable to give the desired effect especially in a wide range of frequencies. It is at this point of time I heard about the QuietComfort noise canceling headphones from Bose. I know that Bose is the leading manufacturer of sound systems and are in the elite category.I realized that quality comes at a price and ordered the headphones. I would say that it is the best headphones I have had so far. Especially while on travel I find the whole world shut out once I put on my headphones. The experience is mind-blowing. Absolutely no distortion.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The headphones are amazing. I compared them to the similar priced Sennheiser and Beats headphones. By far these are the better headphones. The in-store demo units at Best Buy really demonstrate the audio quality and noise canceling. The headphones are light on your head, the aduio quality is amazing, the noise canceling is the best I've ever experienced (or not experienced), and the built in ipod remote in the cable is great. You will hear additional details in the music you never heard before. You can really pick out the instruments and vocals. The sound has depth and unlike most headphones they make me feel like I am in a front row of a concert just for me. Some/most headphones just blast the music out at your where you don't get that depth where if it feels like the sound is coming feet away rather than an inch or two to your ear. These headphones are great, but if you like rap or music with insane amount of bass you may want to get Beats. The bass is great on the Bose, but if all your music is Boom Boom Pow and Rap then you may want to opt for that tiny 8% better bass for that kind of music. I'm not saying the bass is bad on these. I listen to Boom Boom Pow, but I also love country, top 40, rock, rap, r&b;, alternative, audio books, j-pop, and more. Try listening to a song like ""Everywhere"" by Fleetwood Mac and not smile at the quality and depth. I like a little bit of rap and these are fine. Boom Boom Pow sounded amazing. I know, I've actually seen Black Eyed Peas in concert and the song sounded exactly like the concert except for the screaming since it was not the live version of the song. The control on the cable is very handle for anyone with an ipod (1st and 2nd gen may not work with the ipod controls on some versions of the ipods). I can adjust the volume, skip songs, fast forward, rewind, play, and pause with controls. I never have to turn on my ipod touch screen (I always play random). That is a huge selling point since I listen to music every night to relax to that very point you will fall asleep within a minute. The case is very sturdy and feels sturdy enough to protect the bose headphones against nearly anything except sitting on it. The leather on the headphones is soft and genuine and it feels amazing on your head. The ear cups are so soft and comfortable you almost forget your wearing headphones. The noise cancelling at home drowns out my sister if she is more than 10 feet away and my 2 bedroom fans are completely quiet. My room is right next to the attic fan and it virtually drowns it out to next to nothing. The headphones are very stylish with the black on chrome look.Now, the cons. Price. I've known for a while that Bose is the king of headphones imo. These are actually the first Bose headphones I've ever bought. I've kind of had this as my headphone history. Ipod headphones (no bass) -> $6 walmart special ear buds -> $15 aiwa over hear headphones -> sennheiser cx300 (first quality ear buds) -> able planet 1000 series noise cancelling (300 new 55 on ebay since no one knows about them) -> bose qc 15s. I was happy with the able planets since I tested them out at the airport and they blew my sennheiser cx300's out of the water and they were the first noise cancelling headphones I've ever had. I still love them. However, my Dad did something to me. We were early to the theater and went to Best Buy to kill 30 minutes. I saw the Bose booth and tried them out. I just wanted to know how they compared. I tried them out and it was the next level. Sound wise it was only like 9-12% better. Barely a big improvement. Where it was better was the comfort, the audio depth (feeling like your in a concert), and the near complete silence. I heard nothing in Best Buy with the Bose. I hear nothing in my room. My able planets I could hear 20% of the fan noise, but it was less than a whisper. I'm a gadget nut so I had to have them. $300 is a crazy amount of money. So I went to ebay for them. After three days of trying I finally found a like new pair of Bose QC 15s for $195 on ebay. Just a couple of surface scratches and it was the first batch they released in 2010 that did not come with the ipod cable. Oh well on the cable, my ipod touch has volume controls and my able planets did not have it. I ended up finding a $6 ilove adapter that adds the ipod remote to any headphone and I thought I was good. The headphones came in and they were flawed. The sound quality was really good. However, whenever music was not playing I had a hum on the left headphone. I re-seated the cables, swaped batteries, and even borrowed my Dad's ipod and it did not fix it. Now, you think it is not a huge problem. Just listen to music. However, some music have tiny little parts of silence and that will get annoying quick. What I ended up having to do was call Bose and they helped me. It looks like the first batch of Bose headphones do not have a serial number, so unless you kept your box you will have to pay for the repair. They don't actually repair. The offer a $100 trade in option where you can get a new set or the new set of the newest model. Long story short. DON'T BUY USED! I know they are probably pretty rugged, but I am treating these like babies and I will not bring them with me on the plane. Not only because I am worried about them and possibly paying $100 again, but because of space. I am getting into digital photography with slr cameras. I have this case logic bag I am bringing with me so I can listen to music, use my ipad, slr equipment, and a person item or two. In order for it to fit in this bag, I have to have headphones that fit in a space about the size of a can of pop (len's compartment). They had a sale on Amazon a few weeks ago on the 2011 model white Able Planet noise cancelling headphones that fold up and they were $40. I will be using those for vacations. The able planets are amazing. However, I am a bit of a audiophile and I want the Bose at home.I highly recommend these headphones if you have the $300. The noise cancelling, audio quality, and comfort are incredible. By far the depth (concert like sound) and noise cancelling sold me. You will be very happy with these. Anyone who really loves music and travels frequently should buy these. Now, if you are find with giving up 20-25% of the noise cancelling, some depth, and audio quality that is basically within 1/4"" of $300 headphones I would look at the able planets. When I was traveling last March they had those headphones at the airport stores to try. Save yourself some money. Look online and get those able planets used or on sale. My first pair had a msrp of $300 and I got it for $55 on ebay. No one single counter bid since they are not as famous as Bose. If you need foldable get the new white pair for $40-$50 and it sounds 95% as good as my higher quality Able Planet. I'd highly recommend the foldable one for teenagers or anyone who does not travel often and wants a great quality noise canceling headphone on the plane. Just know that besides for the sennheiser cx300's, I have not used the Able Planets or Bose on the plane. I can't comment on that. I know the Bose works great on the plane. If my 80's attic fan is virtually drowned out to a whisper with my able planets than the plane noise should be nearly drowned out to a whisper."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I just bought this headphones and I was expecting something real extraordinary after I was using Able Planet Headphones (Clear Harmony 1100B) which are here in Amazon around $110.00, and guess what? There is no real difference between Able Planet and Bose only in the price ($299 Vs $110).So, my comment is that Bose is now more the branding than the product, at the end all these products are made in China.Something real cool from Able Planet Headphones is that you can use them with the power switch off but with Bose you can't, which means that if your battery dies during a trip, you won't have more music.If you are looking for crisp and clear audio sound and great sound isolation you may have other options as good as Bose, so think about it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've been using my QC2's for a few years and love them to bits, the problem is so does my wife. So, to avoid having to choose between them I got a pair of QC15's for our most recent trip, and was even more impressed. I didn't find any dis-improvements but found 3 significant improvements. 1) I'd say the QC2's cut out approx 80% of airplane noise, with the QC15's it's up to about 95%, the improvement really is that significant when trying one pair on after the other. Having shared my last 2 flights with loud, listen to me Stanford voices droning on for 6 hours solid about their Amazing tech jobs, only the Bose's have prevented in-flight bloodshed. 2) The space for your ear is bigger and more comfortable, you can see the difference best by comparing the mouldings in the case that the earphones sit over. 3) The QC15s come with 2 cables, one is Bose's standard cable, the other has an inline remote control for your iPhone/iPod/iPad (4 & 4S only I think), it has superb ergonomics, volume +/- and play/pause, also a mic I believe but don't take my word for that, it also works fine in the QC2s if you want to accessorize the old things. In short, we're both very happy I got these, and if I ever get to use them again I will be a happy bunny."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel a lot, not just planes, trains and cars but offen staying in hotels and others places that are not quiet.  I'm also an insomniac.  Well I decided after reviews and other info to bite the bullet and spend the money to try these headphones.  First, you do use a small battery so when worn, this activates the white noise so I can sleep peacefully anywhere.  I plugged them into my Kindle to listen to books and its so wonderful, I can't believe how much I have missed as I'm also a little hard of hearing. Of course movies and music on planes is so much better.  I wear glasses but these headphones seal right around them.  Would I buy again?  In a heartbeat yes.  Worth the cost?  Yes.  Nothing is made to last forever but if they give me a year or two before needing to be replaced will still be worth the cost."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"After we moved to Hawaii, long flights became routine. I know I didn't really have to mention Hawaii but what's the point of living in Hawaii if you can't constantly throw it in everyone's face? These headphones are the greatest things ever. You have no idea how loud a plane is until you wear these for a few hours and then remove them. 4 stars only because they create some weird pressure on my eardrums. Other than that they are great for long flights to Hawaii, where I live."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I hesitated buying these as I wasn't sure how good they would be, but they are perfect for traveling or just jamming quietly at home, or just to tune everything out. Noise canceling is great, as is the sound quality."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these for my son for Christmas because he wanted some quality, noise-cancelling headphones that would work for music as well as gaming.  I chose these because the price is not vastly more than other brands but the reputation of Bose lead me to expect better.  I'd previously owned noise-cancelling Sony headphones and was sorely disappointed.  They worked great for about 3 months, then quit working in the noise-cancelling department on one headphone.  I inquired about a warrantee repair but after 90 days it had expired.  3 months into these Bose headphones and my son is thrilled.  He uses the noise-cancelling constantly while watching movies on his ipod and while gaming online and, frankly, it works wonders because I have to remove the earpiece from his ear in order to get his attention.  And no, he doesn't have the sound cranked up loud.  It uses some batteries but the sound quality is excellent - best I've ever heard from any headphones and far better than the Beats headphones at a similar cost."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Awesome, anyways it is from Bose. This is a gift to my son and he is loving it. It does not play music but feels it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,My best friend on an airplane - which I am on frequently!  Great sound - great noise reduction.  Tried the Sony version and was very disappointed.  These are great!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My snobbery was based on the Bose FAQ (here [...] However, this is a fine piece of equipment. I primarily bought this for listening while on public transportation and when flying to reduce my headaches ( the monotonous droning sound of the engines, theorize in part). It is expensive, but well worth it. World of a difference between this and those piddly ear buds when you are on a noisy train or bus. Saves your hearing a bit by giving you the ability to keep the volume down versus the non-noise canceling ones.This equipment however does not change my opinion about their speakers and other electronic equipment."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am a Bose fan, and have been for over 15 years.  From the moment I heard the sound reproduction and noise cancellation quality of the QC15 headset in a local store, I was hooked.  I went out and bought myself a set the next week and have had them now for over 5 years.  So here are the pros and cons:PROs- Excellent active noise cancellation*- Excellent battery life despite the fact that sound from audio sources can only be heard when the headset is turned on- Interchangeable cord feature; multiple audio cords are available and can be swapped out within a few seconds- Comes with a quality carrying case to protect the headsets while traveling or when not in use- Included accessories are an airport audio headset adapter and legacy 1/4&#34; jackCONs- Retail price ($299) has not changed since their release several years ago - there are now several companies that produce headphones of equal performance for less money- Can only listen to a source when the headphones are turned on - not capable of passive sound reproduction- *Active noise cancellation seems to be limited to lower end frequencies which is excellent in elminating most subtle background noises and aircraft engine hum.  Unfortunately, you can still hear people talking - I wish Bose would come out with an updated version that also eliminates the human voice...maybe add a second active noise cancellation switch for filtering out voices?Other thoughts:  I already own one pair of Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones and just recently ordered a second set for my work place.  I decided early on that I did not want to buy another brand new QC15 headset as they are very expensive.  So, I decided to buy a used pair instead from the Amazon marketplace.  Much to my surprise, I received the headsets and they worked perfectly.  There are a few minor wear and tear marks on the outside plastic shells of the ear pieces (as was stated in the item description before I bought them), but the wear was from normal use and is not very noticeable.  The headsets themselves work perfectly and on par with my other QC15 headset I bought new a few years ago.  I am very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend those interested in looking for an excellent active noise cancelling headset but are on a limited budget to consider buying a used QC15 headset - well worth the money!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The good:1. Sound Quality - the sound quality on this is really good. I'm not an audiophile, but these are the best sounding headphones i've owned. the bass is good and the notes are crisp.2. Comfort - They are comfortable for about two or three hours of continuous use. After that, the noise cancellation just gives you a headache.The bad:1. They run on 1 AAA battery, so if you forget to turn them off , they drain fast.  Expect the battery to last about a week with about 2-3 hours of use daily.2. There is no way to turn off the noise cancellation, also they don't work if the battery dies, so remember to keep a battery handy.Undecided:I haven't owned any other noise cancellation headphones, so cannot compare the noise cancellation with other headphones, but i've listened to them with the tv on and they do a decent job of cutting out the background noise."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've been owning this headphone for about 3 years and wanted to chip in my opinion as well.I'm a big headed audiophile, so headphone sizes and comfort matter a lot to me.1. comfortFor big heads, Dr.Dre headphones are no go and that refers to Studio level headphones. I tried them, and putting music quality aside, it was aching my head after a few minutes of listening and I was very afraid of breaking its headband.3 years of usage, bose qc15 never betrayed me. Very sturdy and flexible headphone. My head never hurts and very comfortable (although if you listen to it for a long time, you will eventually get tired...)2. noise cancellingbose always advertises their headphones in front of a kiosk with a loud plane sounded speakers. They are confident that their headphones work and they meant it. Now let's not put the expectation way too high. It won't block everything 100% as if you're in space. You will still be able to hear some stuff outside, but it completely blocks certain types of sounds (plane engine sounds in particular) and you will be very comfortable listening to your music only, fully silencing outside sound.Three years of usage and I can still guarantee that this thing's worth every single penny."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these headphones for work. I sit in an open environment with help desk people just a few feet away from me. They are very distracting and sometimes overly loud. I'm not really a music listener, but I have used some bluetooth headphones to try and dim the noise, however the music can also be distracting.I tried these headphones on a flight before I bought them. The noise reduction is outstanding. When you turn them on, only the higher pitch noises can be heard, everything at a lower level is instantly muted. You can still hear voices if they are very close to you, but on the whole you are sitting in near silence.I bought these headphones direct from Bose because they have a 12 month payment plan. They arrived earlier this week. The build quality certainly doesn't seem to warrant the $300 price tag. They are plasticy and have faux leather. They are still made sturdier than your typical $30 headphone set, but I would have liked to see more aluminum or lighweight metal. My first problem was thay I put the battery in upside down. The door to the battery compartment then jammed and I had to poke something into the crack to get it to re-open. The battery door is very cheaply made.I did not connect the cords as I intend these for providing silence only. When activated, these headphones block almost everything out. You cannot hear low pitch noises at all, and only the clacking of your keyboard will come through. Other people's voices are distant or severely muted - which is wonderful. I know that our secretary is chatting with a co-worker right now, but it's so faint that I don't care. I cannot hear the help desk at all. You don't appreciate how much noise an A/C system makes until you turn these headphones on.I used re-chargeable LiIon batteries to power the headphones and the first battery has lasted 3 days. The battery just started to flash a 5 hour warning to say that it's almost out.On the whole I would say that these are terribly overpriced if you intend to use them as just headphones, but if you are easily distracted or fly frequently, then I would say that they are worth the price.Bose needs to improve on the materials that they use. For the money that they charge, the headphones should be made to last a decade or more."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tried the audia-technica headphones and I can report that the sound quality is not nearly as good and the noise cancelling was lacking as well. Also for someone with a large head those headphones were exceedingly uncomfortable.Enter the Bose headphones. Very comfortable to wear, excellent noise cancelling and great overall sound quality. I can work a chainsaw and listen to a podcast with moderate volume.These headphones are not durable if your an active person such as myself. If you want them for plane rides or commutes I suspect they will work fine and last for awhileNear the connector the plastic started to strip bare after only a few weeks. I've had to wrap it in electrical tape.I dropped these about 2 feet onto a concrete sidewalk and the ear cup completely separated from the headphones forcing me to attempt a fix with gorilla glue to my now, unusable $300 headphones.This is a drop my 10 year old Sennheiser HD-280s could have made 100 times in a row due to superior durability of that product. In fact I am wearing those right now and, despite their age, the performance is superb.Hopefully my glue fix will work for the Bowes headphones, because I enjoy the noise cancelling aspects. My next step will be to try Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones if I am forced to abandon my Bowes."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Coworkers may be loud, but it really doesn't matter when I'm wearing these. More productive hours have been had in quiet lately."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Sound quality is excellent, cancels probably 90-95% of sound.  Comfortable and easy to wear even for a 12 year old.No problems so far with durability.Recommended."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had a Bose QC 3 that I got as a used item. That was simply awesome. I gave that to my dad and was looking out for a new noise cancelling phone. Got a new synnheiser. Synnheiser was ok but certainly could not match a Bose. In the bose that I got as used I used to hear my old song collection in a new different way and lot of low frequency music was easily and noticably reproduced in Bose. Quite disappointed with Synnheiser I was packing it for returns. I ordered this Bose QC Comfort 15 so that it arrives before I could return Synn. Had few hours of parallel testing and Bose was a clear winner. Although Bose loses on the fact that its not a bluetooth enabled headphone, but for the difference between the prices I can easily get a Bose + bluetooth headset and still cost lesser than synnheiser. Bose is wonderful even as a used item, Synnheisser is bad even as a new item."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have traveled internationally for work for the past 2 years which includes flights on very noisy small planes as well as 12-13 hour flights on the giant ones. I desperately tried not to spend the money on these Bose and tried Denon, Ludacris, Sony, and a few other brands of noise-canceling headphones. I couldn't wear any of them for very long because of the discomfort and although the noise cancellation was good, none of them can compare to the Bose. I thought all the frequent travelers had them just because they were Bose... now I know they all have them because they are far and away the best. The sound is awesome (see some of the more technical reviews for details on that), the soundless-ness is awesome (trust me!), and I have worn them and slept in them for entire 8+ hour flights. If you travel, don't waste your time trying to spend less on something else. These are worth every single penny!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"When you first don these headphones you may find them to be so comfortable - with the buttery leather hugging your head sensuously - that you don't care much how they sound.  It's a feeling that strikes me every time.  Turn the music on, and you will hear rich, clear sound.  It's not been since the nineteen seventies that I've seriously listened to sound through headphones, so I cannot tell whether these headphones compare well to other good phones.  What I do notice is that I hear noises in recordings I've listened to for decades through my DCM time windows speakers that I have never heard before.  My impression is that the sound is a little more colored with these than with my speakers, but it's not an unpleasant difference.  In short, I think the sound will satisfy all but the most demanding audiophiles.A great feature is that the earphones work to limit noise reaching your ears even when they are turned off.  Turn them on, and the effect is better.  Listen to music, and even  irritating noises can disappear into the background.  Again, I have not compared these to other noise canceling head phones, but I would characterize them as being pretty effective.Bose has made some design decisions that have proven to be very inconvenient to me.  I use the headphones at my desk when I work on my computer.  This means that it would be much more convenient  if they were powered through the USB cable.  But they're not.  They use triple-A batteries. A lot of triple A batteries - even though they use just one at a time. When the battery begins to get low it will work for a second or two.  Then the earphones will make a loud Pfft! noise that can be heard across the room.  Then silence.  Then, after a couple seconds the system works again for a second or two. And the Pfft!. And so on.  It's so irritating that being forced to listen to this for some time could be characterized as torture under the Geneva Convention. Ironic behavior for a device whose very purpose is to isolate us from sources of sonic discomfort; don't you think?There's another serious problem with the battery.  It's small.  And these headphones never sleep. Forget to turn off the headphones overnight, and you need to put in a new battery.  Listen for a few hours, and you need to put in another battery.  It seems that every time I pick up my headphones I need to put in another battery.  If you buy these headphones you must do one of three things:  either buy the giant boxes of triple A batteries offered at Costco or other wholesale markets, or buy a handful of rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  Or buy lots of shares in a battery manufacturing company of your choice, and write a favorable review of these headphones here.  Whichever you choose, consider it just a cost of using these headphones.  Otherwise you are likely to find yourself constantly out of triple-A batteries, and none of the reasons for spending this much on  good headphones will matter."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"They do an awesome job at noise cancelling.  By noise cancelling, they don&#8217;t just mean passive means of thick padded cups muffling the outside noise &#8211; they mean there are small microphones on the outside and inside of the headset, and using a small battery in the headphones, they actually create a negative sound wave to cancel out the outside sounds.  Result:  does I would call a 100% and sort of &#8220;magic trick&#8221; job at completely cancelling out low end sounds: fan noise, dryer noise, noise of air through heating ducts, traffic going by the house, doors opening and closing.  Does a 80-90% job to cancel out voices: basically you can hear voices still a lot, but because all of the low end is removed from the voice, you hear only a very low volume tinny remnant of the voices around you.  So if your MAIN purpose of buying them is to cut out voices very near around you within just a few feet, know that it does NOT remove 100% of very nearby talkers.All that is just putting on the headset, without even using the cord.  The cord actually can be removed from the phone so you don&#8217;t have to have a dangling wire when you are only using it for noise cancelling.  Flip the switch from OFF to ON, while wearing the headset, and you can hear it go from passive noise cancelling (just due to the pads and cups of the headphone), to active circuitry negating the outside sounds.I remember the first time I donned these, was on a American Airlines flight.  I was sitting in first class, and American Airlines planes are very old, so they don&#8217;t have a separate TV screen for every chair (like a lot of other airlines do &#8211; many like Jet Blue every seat on the plane has its own personal TV that you can watch any movie or whatever separately from your neighbor).  Anyway, since American doesn&#8217;t have individual movie screens, they gave everyone in first class an iPad, and a pair of these Bose headphones.I put them on, and holy crap!  ALL of the plane engine noise disappeared - so much so, that I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing (wasn&#8217;t hearing really).  I didn&#8217;t realize it was using active noise cancelling, I just figured these were the best set of foam padding headphones in the world by design!  I remembered them a month ago around Christmas time when my house was full of my family being home, and after a few days of not getting anything work done while working at home (luckily I don't take phone calls, but work at my computer all day long), I ordered them.It comes with two included snap-in cords: one regular (left/right audio, 3 pin 1/8 inch mini), and one made for iPhones, iPads, and other devices, and another cord - 1/8 inch mini with 4 contacts on the barrel,  that you can use with your iPhone or whatever as a headset with a microphone.  Yes, it will use the microphone that is built into the headset for noise cancelling as a standard audio microphone if you use the second cord.  There's also an inline controller on the cord so you can do volume UP, volume DOWN, and MUTE.  When you start to listen to anything, it drowns out the outside sound even more &#8211; just by diverting your attention I suspect, and the fact that you can play the music so LOW in volume to work, while outside sounds are removed, plain and simply said &#8211; it is a really cool experience for doing quiet concentrative work.I&#8217;ve been wearing them while working every day at home, even now that the wife and daughter are back to work and school, and I am the only one home, I still prefer to wear them to be productive!Sure, maybe if ALL you want is 100% noise cancelling, being around construction, or whatever, maybe a $1.99 set of foam ear plugs, that you roll in your finger to make them small, and let them expand in your ear and block out nearly all the sound, MIGHT be better (I want to do that test to compare as I am interested to see).  But I am totally happy with them, and will never FLY again without bringing them so I can have a super quiet flying experience on any airline, and will now just see how long it takes to burn out the single AA battery with enjoyment all the way!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I didn't realize, how good is the NC of these headphones until I finished trying all the other options available (upto 500$).I am using it for 8 months now and these are the most comfortable headphones I have ever tried with the great sound and a great great NC."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones surpass any other headphones I have or have tried Superb Noise cancellation,  excellent frequency response. ---As one other reviewer put it "" BLISSFUL SERENITY"" .  As I see it, with reasonable  care, there should be no breakage problems and they should last a very long time."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had these for a year and liked them at first. But over time I noticed that my eardrums sometimes hurt from the active noise cancelling, but there was no way to turn it off without still getting audio. I just couldn't use these anymore for regular music listening.I went with the Sennheiser PXC 450, and think they are superior to the Bose."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I use it at work and when I travel. This and my kindle are my best friends when i hop on a plane.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Noise-canceling function of these phones is the best around at this price point, if you read online review sites. Over-ear cups fit great, even over my freakish, giant ears. Very light and comfortable. Battery use seems minimal; I haven't had to replace it yet. Most important, hey sound great! Worth the price.Other notes:I use in conjunction with an Inada Sogno massage chair, and I can wear these comfortably while my head is in the neck/shoulder unit of that chair."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I debated for months on which of the expensive, sound cancelling headphones, should I go with the Beats by Dr. Dre, Sennheiser or the Bose. I determined that for my taste (it is critical that you determine this prior to entering your &#34;shopping&#34; mode as it each offer drastically difference experiences depending on how you like to listen to your music) that the Bose QC15 headphones were it for me. I appreciated the bass that the Beats had, but I'm not a head bopper, not really a fan of rap since I like music with real lyrics and you know, people with real talents so I determined these might not be the fit. I also did not like that they felt like they could break easily.....as a matter of fact, of the various stores I went to look at them (Best Buy, Apple Store, Target) many of the models were actually broken.....surely that can be both attributed to faulty manufacturing as much as moronic teenagers playing around with expensive toys. I didn't like anything about the Sennheiser so I won't elaborate further on that model. By the time I got to the Bose store I was basically pleading in my head for these to be it and I'm so glad I saved these for last because it made me appreciate everything the other two were not to me. I liked the design much better, sleek but classy, the bass and treble are much more balanced providing a nicer listening experience. I tried it with every genre I could find in my library, hip/hop, jazz, folk, alternative, dance music, and the lyrics were much clearer to me. Also, I want to point out, I travel for a living so the &#34;sound canceling&#34; part of these headphones was critical. I'm pleased to say that when they're on the world really is tuned completely out to you which is amazing when you have a screaming kid (or 10) on your plane.Comfort was important to me as well and I like that I can wear them on 11 hour flights without hesitation, without having my ears feel irritated by the material, etc.I do have to note, this is my second pair (thank God for my square trade warranty) because one of the cuffs broke off after much wear and tear which happened after 3 years of wearing on my big noggin' (no surprise it happened really) but with my 2nd pair came two options of cables to plug in to the devices you'll be using. The traditional option and an option which comes with a volume control and speaker for Apple products so that was a nice bonus.In all, I have about a million positive things to say about them but I don't want to bore you all with them, just know, it's the best $300 I spent!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,What a wonderful headphone . I trust of Bose . but I recommend you don't use it when you drive . because will not hear the others cars .
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"There's a lot of talk regarding these lately and how they match up to the beats. I've owned or used a pair of most types of Beats by Dre. Generally, I'm pretty positive on the sound quality of the Beats Studios and I proudly owned them for a bit. I had the matte silver ones so they looked a little less flashy for more conservative environments. Recently, however, I made the switch after a long and drawn out internal debate. I do not regret switching to the QC 15s, and I'll go into some detail why.I'm 32 and an academic, and I have had this difficult time getting past the feeling that I'm too old for Beats. They are, after all, very much geared toward a younger 24 and under crowd. Bose, in my opinion, is not just more mature, but I believe they are a brand that crosses all age groups. Bose is a brand of sophistication, not really bold fashion; sophistication can look amazing too, and these do.Between the Bose and the Studios, I can most honestly say that I cannot tell a lot of difference in the bass except for the Bose sounding a bit more clean. These reviewers stating that the QC 15's have no bass I can't help but think they got a defective pair. I listen to many, many different types of music ranging from dubstep, ambient, and symphony and I believe that Bose offers the all around best and most accurate bass. Combine that with the clearer acoustics, percussion, and everything else you could possibly think of and you have a significantly better sound. As for how they sound in hip hop...I can't stand hip hop, but I have listened to it for the purposes of comparison. Bose still sound better, and there's more than enough bass to satisfy the biggest rap nut.As for appearance, I stress that Beats create a look for fashion, and Bose go for a look of sophistication. Beats seem to be best worn around the neck as far as I can tell. Like I said, they are a fashion accessory. Bose QC 15s are meant to be truly worn, and when you put these things on you feel...well, sophisticated. They look extremely classy.Lets discuss the feel for a moment. Beats Studios, I'll admit, feel great. I have absolutely nothing bad to say on their comfort. Bose QC 15's are significantly lighter, and the ear cushions envelop the entire ear a bit more spaciously than the Studios.  Also, I don't believe the hold in as much heat in the ear cushions as they Studios, but neither one is extraordinarily hot. Also, I wear glasses, so sometimes ear fatigue can be a problem with headphones in general. Neither the Studios or QC 15s caused me any issues, but I was much more prone to forgetting I even had the QC 15s on. They just feel so incredibly light, and part of that is they are made of high grade plastic. Regardless of what you might hear or read, I feel these things are very, very sturdy. The Studios always felt like their folding hinge was going to be a problem at any given time.Noise cancellation? QC 15s have no equal, and the Studios are a joke in comparison. The QC 15s will put you in your own world with your music, and with perfect clarity. The noise cancellation in the Studios creates a low volume static white noise that is very noticeable when listening to lower volume music, especially orchestral symphony and ambient. QC 15s are almost magical. I will forever be shocked by these. Oh and by the way, don't trust the quality exactly from the demo units you see in chain retail stores. Your actual pair sound significantly better, especially the noise cancellation.I won't go any further for fear of droning on, but I will say this: I would buy the QC 15's many times over than get another set of Beats or even Beats Studios. They sound better, the noise cancellation is unrivaled, and their sophisticated appearance are difficult to ""beat."""
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are priceless if you fly a lot; never again will I have to hear the sound of those demonic babies screaming for hours on end. If you fly, you need these, and you will love them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I put them on my girlfriend and she was rocking for hours. They are really fanastic, worth every penny. Buy it"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Forget Beats by Dr. Dre, no matter how hyped up they are.Nothing beats these headphones. From their sound quality to unsurpassed noise cancellation... From their comfort to their battery life... I am a Bose QC QuietComfort guy for as long as they exist.The extra cable that can open iTunes on Apple devices, control their volume while providing a built-in mic is an excellent perk. Especially if you do a lot of videoconferencing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Better than my Audiovon or Beats by Dr. Dre, these are the best at reproducing sound and cancelling out noise."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The QC15 has an amazing abulity to block out virtually all sorts of ambient, continuous noises (airplane drone, street noise, office hubub, A/C blowing), AND reproduce quality sound so you don't have to sacrifice one for the other when needed.The QC15 is built well-enough, but would not be considered rugged in the least. You have to be careful with it--don't expect to leave it lying around or hooked around your neck or shoulder for periods of time when not in use. It probably needs to be kept in its case.I used my QC15 recently on a long flight from the States to Southeast Asia, aboard a Singapore Airlines Airbus A380. I had some issues using my QC15 with the in-flight entertainment system. There was a constant buzzing sound that made it impossible to use on movies. I had my backup Audio Technica ANC23 Noise-Cancelling earbuds, and did not have this problem (I had to fiddle with the in-line volume control by bumping up the volume on the ANC23 and turning down the master volume on the in-flight system. The ANC23 does not have nearly as good noise cancellation as the QC15, but in this particular instance, it won out. Too bad the in-linw controls for the QC15 is only for iPod use. I switched out the battery and used a different airline adapter--same problem. However, when I used the QC15 with my iPod, no issues whatsover--the sound was pristine clear minus all ambient noise. Unbelievable.Had the same issues on the return flight, so I am not sure whether it is the plane, the entertainemtn system, an incompatibility with the QC15, or a combination of the three. Just be aware there may be some issues with using the QC15 on some in-flight systems, and it is not a deficiency in the headphones per se, since it works perfectly well in all other respects.Your best bet for the best combination of noise cancellation and quality sound."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"So BOSE is pretty much what I use for most of my audio, from my car to my 5.1 living room to my ear buds to my QC 15's, I really REALLY like BOSE stuff.  These phones are VERY good and worth the $.  I like the fact that if you break them (I did and that's mostly why I gave a 4 star rating as I am pretty careful with my stuff). I did travel a lot with these and figure that is why the headpiece eventually cracked, but would have appreciated a stronger frame.  Comfort is great, sound is BOSE and NC works as it should.  One of the upsides to owning BOSE equipment is the replacement cost.  When I did eventually crack my headset, the replacement for a brand new set was less than $100.00, which made the frustration manageable."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"As soon as I put these on without even having any audio coming through them I was hooked.  Drowns out everything.  And when you actually start playing something you realize why everyone loves these things.  If you can swing it, order them.  You won't regret it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I fly to Asia a lot, and these make a world of difference.  They are comfortable for long periods.  And, they really quite the noise of the plane letting me rest.  Totally worth it for me.  Oh yeah, they sound good too!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love the Bose QC15 head phones so much, I bought a second pair, one for home and travel, and one to leave at work. The first pair I bought nearly 3.5 years ago, and they still work as well as the day I bought them. I did have to replace the ear pads on the first pair a few months ago, but this is after using them nearly every day since I got them. You can order the ear pads directly from Bose for around $30 dollars. The case for these even has enough room to store a couple extra AAA batteries, and a small device (I store my Zune HD in it). The noise canceling on these is superb. I work in an open environment (no cubicles) so there can be a lot of conversations going on at once, and this allows me to stay focused for many hours of coding. It's also very good for use on long flights."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I don't know how I've gone so long without these! I travel on 40-50 flights a year and always struggle to relax. These blank out the world and only certain sounds can be heard at a low volume. They completely block out the droning sound of the airplane engines. When paired with music, you can't hear anything going on outside of the headphones.I'm buying another set for my wife."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"As a heavy business traveler, (planes, trains, and automobiles), I consider a good quality pair of noise cancellation headphones a necessity. My first pair of noise cancellation headphones were the old Bose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Canceling Headphones. I purchased them in 2004 and they never let me down. It was only after the battery pack started giving me trouble that I decided to upgrade to the newer Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones in 2013. The quality and functionality was night and day! Not that I was disappointed with the QC2 headphones, the flexibility, removal of the battery pack, and sound quality were far superior.However, I made that purchase just a few months before Bose released the in-ear Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. That didn't bother me too much, because I assumed that over the ear headphones would do a better job at blocking out ambient noise. And I was skeptical that an in-ear headphone could really be comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Again, I was very wrong. After a little contemplation and with Bose's 30 day money back guarantee, I decided to buy the QC20s to test and compare the two Bose products.Comfort:Like any over-the-ear headphone, there will be time where you will sweat after wearing it long periods of time. The QC15 is no exception. It is not as bad as some cheaper models from rivals, but an hour commute on the MTA and NJ Transit in the afternoon rush would easily and quickly make my head sweat. So there would be times where i would remove them just to breathe, which defeated the purpose of having noise cancellation headphones. But I must reiterate, this will happen with any over-the-ear headphones, not just Bose.The QC20 is an extremely comfortable in-ear headphone that eliminates any and all 'hot head' issues caused by the QC15. This is a huge advantage in my opinion. And though it took me a few wears to realize which size ear pieces (included in the box) fit my ear best, it is now an easy and perfect fit. I flew across the country last week on a 6 hour flight and never felt the need to take out the headphones to rest my ears or due to any discomfort. They were very relaxing and to a point became unnoticeable.Functionality:I have nothing bad to say about the quality and functionality of the QC15. Other reviewers have correctly mentioned that at times it feels like you listening underwater when you just have the noise cancellation engaged without music. However, when music is played through the headphones, all quirkiness goes away. And the noise cancellation is top notch innovation that you would expect from Bose.Regarding the QC20, I put it on an equal platform in terms of noise cancellation. However, the underwater hiss that many users of the QC15 speak about is not there for the QC20. But what is there is a big, ugly, inconvenient at times rechargable battery pack at the end of the headphones rear the plug-in connector. Bose, WHY??? Actually, I understand why. There has to be a place for the components to make the in-ear headphones function, but the size and placement of the pack reminds me of the old battery pack attached to the QC2 I owned over 10 years ago. Surely, Bose could have innovated a smaller pack or made the cord slightly longer so it wouldn't always get in the way of the device your are plugged into. But it is definitely not a deal breaker for me, just an annoyance.Bottom Line:Depending on your needs, the QC20 is not a functional upgrade from the QC15, but it is a better choice if you are comparing between purchasing one or the other. The quirks of the QC15 outweigh that of the QC20. The most notable being 'hot head'.The QC20 are ultra portable, convenient, great battery life from the rechargeable pack, and comfortable to wear. I suggest you give them a try knowing that Bose has a 30 day satisfaction guarantee."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love these headphones. I have traveled with them and the noise reduction is incredible.  I am very picky when it comes to ear comfort and I cannot use earplugs or buds of any type.  The shape and softness of the bose is nice but after an hour or so I start fidgeting with them as for my taste, I would prefer they cover an even bigger area of my ear, but I never expected perfection when it came to shape - I have large ears & lobes.I only wish this company would make a blue-tooth version for TV/PC use as fooling with a cord with is getting old.I use this on my PC when I want to watch a movie and I need to keep things quiet - works great here.I have traveled and used for watching a movie on a flight, although I don't like the pressure on my ears after about an hour. On a flight, the noise cancelling is top notch and worth the price.TIP:  Take extra batteries as I have left these on without realizing - the headphones will ""beep"" to let you know."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Paid $300 on bestbuy, and they lasted 3 months before the left earcup stopped working. Tried to contact Bose, but they won't help me since I don't have my receipt anylonger. So these are going in the garbagecan. First and last Bose product ever, stay far away from these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The new Bose headphones are awesome!!!They are everything that I was hoping for, and everything that I anticipated in an isolating headset.Great isolation. I can now listen to quiet music while other household members play theirs loudly. A blessing to be sure. I would definitely recommend them for anyone. Put my cheapie non-isolating headphones to shame."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Pros:* Great noise reduction, completely satisfies my need for isolation in noisy office.* Lightweight for its size.* Long cord.* Nice firm-shell carrying case.* Includes an iPhone cord with microphone.* Battery in earpiece (not in a separate clunky module).* Sound is good.  I'm no audiophile, and my hearing isn't that great, but evenI can tell there's a huge improvement compared to earbuds.  I can understand conversations a lot more easily.Cons:* The iPhone cord microphone is in the wrong place (it's up by your ear).  Listeners tell me I sound a little faint.* It doesn't breathe around the ear (you can get hot or sweaty).  This may be unavoidable for the desired level of noise elimination.  I got used to this pretty quickly and it doesn't bother me much any more.* Stationary, there's no problem, but if you're walking and stepping heavily, and if the battery is low, it might crackle or cut out for a moment.  I think this only happens when the battery is low.* If you're outside and there is any wind, it will make a whistling noise.Overall: better than anything I've tried previously, for noise reduction and sound, for use in the office or relaxing at home.P.S.  I would wish that at this price point it would include Bluetooth and Airplay but it doesn't."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Wife uses them on all our trips. Comfortable for long term use. Cuts out outside noise really well. No problems yet.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've read a lot of reviews on here that are from audiophiles with an acute understanding of what makes a set of headphones good... for them.  I'm a regular guy, though, and honestly I won't be able to comment on the nuances of highs, lows and mid ranges.  I can however, tell you about these headphones from the perspective of an average guy who has used them every day for the past year - and if you're like me, then hopefully this 'average guy' review will help you out.SOUND:  Like I said, I can't speak about sound quality relative to other headphones at a technical level.  What I can tell you is that to me, these head phones sound great.  The defining sound characteristic that I would use is clarity.  When you put the headphones on, and turn up the volume, there is a distinctly clear sound.  Every hit of percussion, ever rumble, every note sung by every voice all sounds perfectly clear, as though you're in the room with the music being played.  The first time I heard it, I was blown away.  And I think the true testament to its quality of their sound is that when I put them on, the still amaze me.BASS:  A lot of people I've spoken to love bass.  They love that deep, booming, low frequency rumble.  If that's your thing, then these probably aren't the head phones for you.  They have good lows, but it's not going to shake your ears.  Again, the bass is solid and crystal clear, but it's not like putting on a set of Beats headphones which, for my tastes, have a little too much bass.NOISE CANCELLING:  Hands down THE best feature on these headphones.  The main reason I got these was so that I could tune out noisy environments and focus on either the music, or my task at hand.  I sampled a lot in various stores, and these were 100% the best.  All noise cancelling headphones work on the same principal - they play opposite frequencies of what's going on outside to eliminate the noise when you're listening.  Bose nailed it.  It works best with constant noises (i.e. jet engines, bus engines, etc...), and it's nothing short of amazing to hear - or not hear!COMFORT:  If you're like me, and you have your headphones on a good portion of the day, then comfort is king.  My ears aren't small, but they still fit comfortably inside the cups.  The cups themselves, gently rest on the top of your ear, but in a way that is truly unobtrusive.  The padded head rest is simple, elegant, and incredibly comfortable.  I've had these on up to 10-12 hours a day, and not once in the past year have I ever felt discomfort.  In some ways, you don't even realize you're wearing them.BUILD QUALITY:  Excellent.  They feel solid.  They're sturdy and great to look at.  The battery port which you will have to open and close opens well, and secures perfect every time.  They cost about 300 bucks, and they feel like it.  I did have one technical issue which I'll address below in customer service.CUSTOMER SERVICE:  I had an issue where my left cup was occasionally giving me some static.  It didn't always do it, and it would have been next to impossible to replicate on demand.  Regardless, I called up customer service and I was blown away by how amazing they were.  First - I actually spoke to someone after an incredibly short wait which is a rarity these days.  The individual I spoke to was kind, courteous, and assured me that they'd replace my headphones immediately, even if they couldn't replicate the issue.  They sent me a return label (since I purchased on Amazon as opposed to in the store), and as soon as I shipped them back to Bose, Bose shipped me a brand new set.  On top of that, the new set they sent me came with it's own BRAND NEW warranty.  I don't know of any other company that will give you a completely new warranty when your original product has an issue.  Bose simply has the best customer service.  It's part of what you pay for, and 9 times out of 10 you won't need them.  But when you do, you'll understand why they're the best.ACCESSORIES:  The headphones come with a nice case that is perfect for safely transporting your headphones, a couple spare batteries, and your headphone cables.  You'll also get two headphone jacks - one which has an microphone in it for use with your phone's voice calling features, and another that is just a simple connector.  I leave that one at work and it's conveniently always there for me.CONS:  The only con on this headphone set is the battery requirements. Since these have active noise cancellation, they need power to run, and power requires battery.  I use standard AAA batteries, and one battery will last me about two weeks of daily use.  When the battery runs out, you'll have to pop another one in as the headphones won't operate without them.  That is literally my ONLY complaint, but it's a fair trade for how fantastic the noise cancellation is.From the perspective of an average consumer, I can say without reservation that these headphones will blow you away and are worth EVERY penny.  If you're on the fence about them, don't be.  These should be your new headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are fantastic headphones and are considerably better at reducing low frequency noises like jet engines, wind, and road noise than the prior version (The QC2). They are very comfortable, and like the QC2s before them, come with a nice carrying case that can also hold an Ipod or other MP3 player.I've been using noise cancelling (""NC"") headphones since I purchased my first pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2's about 7 years ago. NC headphones are great for eliminating both road noise when going on long car trips and for eliminating engine and wind noise when flying on commercial airliners. None of the noise cancelling headphones on the market today are good at cancelling out noise from people talking, babies crying, etc., and so if you're looking for something to do that, you'll be unhappy with any NC headphone, including these.After I owned the QC2 for a while, I compared them to comparable products from Sennheiser (PXC-250) and Sony. My verdict then was that the QC2's were better, but the Sennheisers (PXC-250) were also quite good, particularly considering the price difference (the Sennheiser model was about $100 back then). I found the Sony models to be way too heavy and too small for my head.A few years later, Bose put out the QC3, which was as good as the QC2, but required you to use a proprietary rechargeable battery. The QC3 was also a bit smaller than the QC2 and did not completely cover year ear. I'm against proprietary rechargeables, because they are expensive, and you will often find yourself with a dead battery and no way to charge them. The QC2's used standard AAA batteries, which allows me to use standard alkaline or re-chargeable Nichel Metal Hydride batteries.I'm pleased to see that the QC15's don't continue the trend towards expensive, proprietary batteries. Instead, they use standard AAA's, just like the QC2s. Even better, the QC15 is considerably better at noise reduction than the QC2. If you can spare $300, it's well worth the upgrade.If you can't afford $300, the $100 Sennheiser PXC-250 is a very good second choice. The PXC-250 does not cover your ears, and so it won't really block out any external noise. In contrast, the QC15's do cover your ears and thus have some noise reduction just by virtue of the fact that they cover your ears.In either case, I highly recommend that you purchase Eneloop rechargeable batteries, which keep their charge for up to a year when not used, and a La Crosse BC-900 charger, both of which you can buy at Amazon.com."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Got these for my many flights. Noise cancelling is simply excellent. If combined with ear plugs I cannot imagine what would wake you up. Music and sound books sound great to me but I'm no audiofile others may differ. Because these are closed to keep out noise I get hot around my ears on longer trips and wake up with ""sweaty"" ears. Not a big deal for me but may be good to know before you buy. I do not think they feel flimsy but I have not had them long enough to say anything about their life span. On the other hand I can say this; if they serve me well for 2 years I will consider it a good purchase, as heavy travel does tend to wear down things faster than at home. One star off for the somewhat high price (even if I do not see any real competition at this price point).UPDATE: Thought I had lost these and bought the Bose QC3 in stead. So now I can compare the two main Bose models directly.Noise cancelling effect:Noise cancelling system is equally effective on both models. However, the closed design of the QC15 give them a slight advantage when it comes to sheer noise blocking (not all noises are handled by the noise cancelling system).Music:No difference to me. But as mentioned above I not an audiophile and I spend far most time listening to audio books anyway.Comfort:This is probably what people should choose after between the two. QC15 cannot escape the fact they are bulky + closed design may give you  ""sweaty"" ears as mentioned above. However, I personally still prefer QC15 because my ears are quite sensitive to presure and I cannot have the QC3 mounted for a long distance flight (5 hours+) without resting my ears once in a while. Not doubt that QC3 are easier to sleep with due to less bulk if you have a custom shaped pillow (I always bring one with a special ""dip"" for the earphones).Operation:Same cord system and built-in remote iphone/ipad control. However, the battery system is distinctly different. The QC15 takes standard batteries while the QC3 relies on a special battery unit you have to charge. The special battery on the QC3 saves weight and lasts for 15 hours (also in real life use). However, the draw down is of course the need for a charger, special battery and for charging. As I do gruelling 30 hour+ flights this is an issue. Some people buy an extra battery for their QC3. Recommended if you travel a lot but it adds even more to the extra price for the QC3.Travel size/weight:In-box the size difference is too small to matter. The QC3 box is smaller, but not by much. The QC15 case is actually more neat on the inside because there are fewer parts to go around and the QC3 box design seems less well thought out. QC3 is lighter and you can feel the difference.Conclusion:Get the pair that fits your ears - I deeply regretted getting the QC3 instead and am very happy that I have my QC15 back - but YMMV and QC3 may be the better choice for others."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My first set of these was a split second decision at an airport just before I boarded an overseas flight. I had never had a set on before and had to set them up on the airplane. Nothing to it, just put in the battery. Plugged them into my Ipod and it was like hearing music for the first time. These things are amazing. they are so comfortable I don't realize I have them on. I plug them into the airplane system to watch movies, into the computer to watch a late night movie in bed, or just for the quiet. Won't travel without them now. I still can't sleep on an airplane, but it knocks out most of the plane noise and the flight is much more enjoyable and I barely notice the screaming little kids that always seem to be near by. My new wife spends a lot of time on the phone or computer talking to her friends and family in Thailand and we both love them for that. She can hear perfectly and I can't hear them perfectly when she wears them. Great product, recommend them highly. I had never seen these below $299, but Amazon came through with a better price. Thanks Amazon"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,It's a heaven sent for noisy environment like where I work. I could care less now about people yapping all days or printers around my office...yeahhhh!!!.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I own both the Bose QC15 and Beats Studio and these headphones are way better than Beats in terms of build and sound quality.  Get this if you care about quality and get the Beats if you're just trying to make a hipster fashion statement.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,what?  noise cancelling headphones that i can't charge?  what the hell is that?  i had to buy a boat load of triple a batteries.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bose products are said to be good; unfortunately, Bose has begun infesting my net usage with pop-ups.  I never support companies who can't lay out an honest, off-to-the-side advertisement, but instead employ crude, in-your-face vulgarity."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"i haven't used any other products, but these work great! used them on the plane many times, and they work flawlessly.  cancels out quite a bit of the noise so you hear your audio more clearly without having to crank up the volume too high!  very comfortable, you can wear them for hours without them hurting.  batteries last a very long time as well, so no worries about running out of juice mid-flight on long trips.  ear cups are easy to replace as well if needed.  bose customer service is great.  if they are still under warranty, you can ask for replacement cups or cord, and they'll ship them for free, no questions asked.  just make sure you register them on their site!  accidentally caught the headphone wire with my vacuum, and the connector snatched off.  since there is a connecting end on the headphone, this was easily replaced.  a little pricey, but worth the money.  i am however curious to compare them to the less expensive audio technica models."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I saw some videos compare this headphone with Beat on Youtube. then I think this is the right one I should buy. noise cancelling is so good!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I love them and they do cut outside noise from the music or anything else you are listening too. Pretty good bass but not exceptional bass. Pure sound.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"For starters I have had these for well over a year now using for 6+ hours a day, so I'm not just reviewing a product I got yesterday like most reviews you'll see.  I absolutely love these headphones, the sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is incredible, by far the best I have ever tried, out of the 10 or so others that I have used including Sony, Dre, and many others. My only complaint with them is that after a year they stopped working where the place that you plug the cable into the headphones got damaged causing them to no play any sound, the reason why this review is still 5 stars though is because Bose has unquestionable  far the best customer service of any company I have ever dealt with, when I told them the problem and how they were out of warranty based on the sales date but not the date I had received them. They had immediately agreed to exchange them for new ones.  They even paid for the shipping both ways which is something I had never seen a company ever do (usually with higher-end things you pay to ship it to them and they pay to ship it back). If you are in the market for noise cancelling headphones with great sound, plus don't want a company giving you the run around as soon as something goes wrong, then I strongly recommend that you by these.Lastly, the ones I had at first was the old version, the ones they were replaced with are the new version."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are amazing.Once you put them on, you can still hear background noise. Then you turn on the noise cancellation switch, and the loudest plane noises are gone. I can't image flying without these headphones.Also they are very light and comfortable."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Good - Well designed, great dynamic sound and noise reduction is the best out there.Bad - no option to listen without noise cancelling feature."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Bought these as a present for my son who travels a lot.  He had borrowed my older model Bose headphones and liked them a lot.  So I wanted mine back and gave him the new ones
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Comfortable and great sounding, these headphones are the best! They are so effective at blocking out background noise that your kids will NEVER hear you again while hearing these. That's annoying but the headphones deliver on the heritage of Bose sound quality very well."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I did a lot of research on these headphones.  I didn't want to pay the full price on them and thought that ebay or other cheaper options on Amazon would work.  I realized that this product is so much more than headphones and that little things that are critical could be wrong with an underpriced one.  The microphone in it is specifically designed to cancel the noise - if there is anything subpar or broken with it - you've completely waisted your money on a 'deal'.  So I decided to pay full price & actually got a price cut with getting an Amazon credit card instead.Flight time: This cuts out that airplane noise about 90%.  I kept thinking it didn't really matter overall, but amazingly when I used them, I felt so much calmer on all the flights and that really is a big deal with all the stress of traveling.  I originally bought these because we had a red eye flight and I wanted to sleep.  It worked pretty well, but it does not cut out sharp noises, kids crying.  You can actually hear someone talking directly to you pretty well which can be good or bad depending on the situation.  But overall, it's the best product & technology out there.  It was worth it to us.  (It also cuts out the sound of snoring at night too).FYI - I didn't take the time to read the instructions ahead of time for my flights & wished I could control the volume - later I discovered there's a hidden volume control inside the cord connection."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Very happy with the Bose headphones - I have used mainly for travel. They fit well around the ear & are very comfortable (as a smaller person the headband fits a little loose even at its most compact setting but the pad at the top helps so they don't slide off). Lighter weight then expected for the technology. Noise canceling is impressive in environments with continuous low to moderate level noise (airplane, in home or public places) but does not cancel all noises out completely. Loud talking and high volume noises (ex. a movie with hefty action scenes) are muffled but audible. Sound quality is good but seems a little flat when the noise canceling option is enabled. Headphones come with a nice carrying case to keep them in one piece - easily fits into a backpack or medium sized travel bag. Overall great product for portability, comfort, & some peace & quiet."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I was influenced by very high consumer reports rating and as always they are right. I used this on an international BA flight and it worked great. Didn't need any additional adapters. I use this at work and I can see a positive difference. I love this product. No issues so far.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have these headphones from Bose and a set of Able Planet True Fidelity Active Noise Canceling Headphones. My husband also has the Able Planet headphones.  I absolute love my Bose headphones since my husband and I have our office in the same room.  He speaks pretty loud during his conference calls and I don't want to hear him talking since I need to concentrate on writing and analysis projects, so the Bose works great in this regard. I switched to the Bose from the Able Planet headphones since I became frustrated with hearing my husband through the Able Planet headphones.  I am very glad that I switched!  On top of the better noise cancellation, the Bose headphones are way more comfortable for me.  I wear earrings, so that may be a factor, but I'm not going to take my earrings off and on when I put my headphones on.  Of course, the sound quality is great and I use the convenient microphone for my own webinars/conference calls.  People say they can hear me just great.  Another thing I noticed with the Bose is the case is much smaller for travel and the switch on the headphones is in a much better position when storing.  The Able Planet switch would get accidentally turned on during travel and the battery would end up dead (so I started taking out during travel).  But either way, I am not going back to Able Planet now, the Bose headphones are for me.For those of you who are concerned about the price, I would say it depends on your needs or wants.  The battery can be easily taken out of the Able Planet for travel and if you do not have a loud officemate to worry about the noise cancelling works pretty good for travel considering the price.  Also ask yourself how much noise cancelling do you want?  Bose definitely works the best and is more comfortable as well."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These Bose QuietComfort 15 noise canceling headphones are the perfect solution for me to read in quiet. I love being immersed in a book on my Kindle, while my husband watches TV. I was just too distracted by all the noise in the room. The noise cancelling feature puts everything in the background, and with a relaxation audio playing, all other sound disappears. (I use an underwater MP3 while I read.) The sound quality is vibrant and rich, and the ear cups are incredibly soft, so they are extremely comfortable. They offer the superior quality that I have come to expect from Bose, and come with a nice hard case for storage or travel. Wonderful!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've heard all the jokes about Bose.  I've even made a few of them myself, and I don't consider their products to be bad, just not worth the premium price.  I use audiophile level equipment in my home, and I seriously debated about a pair of B&W; P5's instead of these.Now, let me say that the B&W;'s sound far better than the Bose.  However, I have B&W; speakers in my home.  I don't need the Bose there.  Where I do need them is on the road.  This is where the Bose shines.  The noise canceling feature works as described and is absolutely wonderful.  I use them in the office, on the plane, on the train, and everywhere else in between.  Often, I'm using them without any music at all, because I just want to shut the world out so I can concentrate and do work or sleep or whatever it is I need to do.You'll find among frequent travelers, this is the headphone of choice.  There's a reason, and it's simply that nothing comes close to the noise canceling these headphones provide.As far as playing music through them?  Well, they're Bose.  They're good quality Bose, but they're still Bose.  Still, they're better than most products out there, including the ultra-trendy Dre Beats, and will beat any in-ear headphone you want to name.  They could be better, but I can't complain.  I didn't pay $300 for them for the audiophile sound quality.  I paid for the noise canceling, which it delivers in spades and would be worth the $300 even if it didn't play music at all."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Got these as a reward for my points on my credit card after what, 10 years of credit card use?  But they were free so I can't complain.  I was debating whether or not to get these or the Beats Studio so I went in to Best Buy to check them both out myself.  The Beats really looked and felt flimsy.  I really wasn't that impressed with the build quality at all.  They just seemed poorly made and comparing the two I felt like the Beats would not hold up very well in the long run.  The Bose QC 15's felt way better IMO.  I tried both on and maybe I have small ears, but they both covered them pretty well.  Sound wise I was only able to listen to the Bose because the Beats had a broken cable so the music didn't come through the headphones at all. The Bose sounded really good and while I didn't get to hear the Beats, just by the way they felt and how flimsy they looked, I chose the Bose.  They came in yesterday and I was amazed at how well they blocked out ambient noise.  I had a basketball game on close by and they just blocked about 95% of the sound right out without any music playing.  Once I played some music they I could hardly hear anything else at all.  Very impressed and I can't wait to try them on my next trip!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Well the title says it all, I hate to buy things because of the name. And I have always felt that Bose was always over loved just because it's a Bose. Little back story, my wife has been bugging me for years about my midnight snack habit; crunch chew, swallow. What can I say I get hungry when watching mindless zombie movies. Well these little wonders of technology are great. So not only can I crunch away but I can turn up the zombie madness.Made very well, have a 300 dollar feel to them, so don't worry about the cost. They do block out a lot of noise, maybe not all of the bubble guppies, they have loud pricing voices. But seriously, I'm thinking about a second set for me!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money on these, but I am so glad that I did.  What finally made me do so was facing a trip from Minnesota to Bangalore, India.  I'm a light sleeper, so I wasn't looking forward to it.  I'm not sure that I would have survived without them.  Because they go around the ears, it was hard to get comfortable with them on, but they did a terrific job on blocking the sound and I was able to sleep some.  Since then, I've used them on other flights where people around me were noisy and it really decreased my stress level to be able to shut it out.  I must say that I think that they couple with the engine noise to work better.  In my office, I find that a lot of the ambient noise around me still comes through unless I turn the music up a little higher than I want to when I'm trying to concentrate.  That said, not a moment of regret - they paid for themselves on that one trip alone."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"EDIT: I have decided to deduct another star from this product to 2 stars from 3.Since as mentioned the Bose build quality is so fragile, and I saw a steal on Newegg on Sennheiser HD428 for a mere $30, I bought it for my office to use as a work horse.The moment I put on the Sennheiser is like ""holy... this is where all my sounds have been hiding"". The audio stage of this un-burned, brand new headphones is just so much wider, so much fuller than Bose, which has been burned in properly.Too late to return the Bose and it's still good for noise cancellation on the planes. But I don't see any reasons to buy the Bose if you don't fly monthly.-----I have to say I am quite disappointed in this purchase, though it's not bad enough that I kept it. I will personally not purchase another Bose product after this experience and you should know your priority if you want to but this product.Noise cancellation: 9/10Needless to say, very good. If you fly every week, this will be a great purchase for you.Audio quality: 3/10Extremely disappointing. It sounds worse than the $100 Klipsch headphones I have, sounds even worse than my car audio. Admittedly my car has a nice B&O; system, but a headphone should not sound worse than a car, period.The base is non-existent... It's not weak, it's not muddled, it's just not there. So basically you miss out on a big chunk of music you are listening to. Treble is nothing to write home about and the sound stage is very weak for a headphone. Basically, you can get better audio quality from $100 headphones.Build quality: 3/10It's built like a $50 phone and the plastic has a very flimsy quality to it. I am pretty sure it will break down within 3 years of light use.Comfort: 6/10Surprisingly not good too, but this is very personal and much depends on your ear size and shape. It doesn't cover my rather large ears completely and you can clearly feel the pressure. Maybe it will get better after more usage.I kept this purely because I have other better-sounding headphones and home audio system, and this one will just be used for flying. If you are looking for an all-rounder and want great audio quality, I would suggest you to skip this one."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These could NOT of arrived sooner. Daily dealings with overly rambunctious co-worker conversations had me thinking these might be a good idea. I could NOT be more happy. Once you put them on you're in your own little world. You can still hear someone if they talk, but it's so much more easily ignored. I plugged mine into my Mac and enjoy Spotify without ANY interruptions. Highly recommended for sound quality and all-out sanity :)"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Can i give this 6 stars??  Wow, this is truly an awesome set of headphones.  Love them for their noise cancelling, and they also give 2 different audio cords to connect to a phone/mp3 device.  It allows you to control a iphone/ipod/ipad with one of them too."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Just received mine yesterday - the only thing I have found thus far is that the instructions could be clearer and simpler.  Took me a few minutes to find out how to put the battery in. :)  I work in an office building that has white noise generation, and I also sit right underneath an air handler that has a serious rumble to it, not to mention the sound of the air actually moving.  It's not annoying, but it's loud.  I put these on, without the power switch turned on, and could still hear all of it.  Flipped the power switch and all I could hear was deafening silence.  My next trip is a few weeks out - be interesting to see how these perform seated next to an engine on an A321, but I am expecting them to work quite well - much better than my Sony N/C headphones that broke on this last trip....  Will post a followup review if I experience anything less than expected, but right now, I am VERY happy!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The last time I tried Noise Reduction headphones, it was over a decade ago.  They were pointless then and I never gave it a second thought.  But that was then.  Things have changed.These headphones are amazing, but these aren't for everyone.  Who should buy these?  People that are easily irritated by random noises, ambient noise, that kind of thing.  What's that?  On my list, I'd put in dog barks, refrigerator hums, bathroom pipes, passing cars, wind and rain, etc.  I'm very sensitive to noise.  I bought a wall clock specifically without a ticking noise because it drives me insane.A couple months ago, some dude moved into a nearby apartment unit.  He's got some kind of affliction that is a cross between emphysema and tourette's syndrome.  He'll make some sort of ""Hnnghh!"" sound every minute or so right out his window.  This goes on all day and all night and for someone like me who is easily annoyed, it can make a muhfuh go postal.Now, I'm a headphone nerd.  I've got a Sennheiser HD-650, a Denon AH-D2000, tried all the upper-middle class Beyerdynamics, Audio Technicas and what have you.  How's this sound in relation to the grade A audiophile headphones?  The sound signature on these is a bit less bassy than your average Bose product.  If I use bass boost on my iPod Touch, it sounds about right.  It doesn't compete with my HD-650 or D2000 and you should not buy these if all you want is great music.You should buy this if you can't stand stupid little distracting noises that drive you up the wall.  Have ADHD?  This is the headphone for you.  You can turn it on (one AAA non-rechargeable battery) and let noise cancelling work.  You can detach the wire so that nothing is in your way if you just really want to get work done.  I'm studying for the BAR Exam and little noises can derail an entire day.You might be saying to yourself that you can just use earplugs instead of spending $300.  And you can.  I've used earplugs for the last few years.  These headphones are so much more comfortable, they block more noise, and you can actually put on music if you want.  It's one of those things that you didn't know you needed until you have it.  You'll also notice how you can leave the volume very low on your music player because there's no need to drown out extraneous ambient noise.  The perfect headphone for people with tinnitus.Now, the aesthetics.  Let's face it, these look like garbage.  Who's the kind of person that thinks these look good?  Look at the stock photo.  Those are the people.  No style, no taste.  People who collect glass figurines.  Those people.  So this purchase is going to strictly be a utilitarian one.  Yes, it looks like crap.  But more importantly, it neutralizes noise.  My God, it's about as close as you can get to enjoying the silence of the night desert while living in the heart of a downtown metropolis.If you're OCD about noise, if you're the kind of person who stays up all night on the internet and can't get to sleep for stupid reasons, if refrigerator buzzing, laundry and dishwasher cycles, passing cars bug you more than it does other people, then look no further.  Sell your kidney on the black market and get these ugly headphones.EDIT:  December 12, 2011One thing that bummed me out about these was the lack of bluetooth.  I turned these into a bluetooth model by ordering a Jabra Clipper.  I've use the excess wire to wrap the Clipper against the headband and now I'm completely wireless.  It pairs perfectly with my MacBook Air 2011 model.  No issues whatsoever.  I also have a Lenovo x120e, but it cuts out intermittently on that notebook.  Don't know if it's a Windows 7 issue or a Lenovo issue.  IPod Touch works without issue as well.Just a little FYI if you want to go bluetooth wireless.  I imagine you're not limited to the Jabra Clipper.  It should work with other devices like the Sony Ericsson MW600, but I can't vouch for solid pairing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tested the noise canceling ability of these headphones on a 10 hour flight to Hawaii. They reduced the ambient noise level of the airplane by at least 90%. When I had it connected to my Ipod, the music quality was superb, and the noise cancelBose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphonesing was complete. I also tested the headphones at my WOW gym, where there is a lot of background noise. Once again the background noise is almost completely cancelled and the audio from the TV or my Ipod is great. These headphones are well worth the money."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Noisy kids on long flights drive me nuts and this quieted them out significantly! Even better I didn't have to crank up my music because these cancelled out a lot of the noise on the flight. My ears weren't ringing at the end of the flight and they felt great on my ears after long use. Thank heaven! or Bose!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Best product I've ever had along with my Ecco slip on dress shoes. Yes, the construction on the headphones seems somewhat 'cheap'. But the only time I've broken them (I've had two pairs now) was my own fault. When I took care of them, they were perfection. Also, Bose is one helluva good company to deal with for customer service. They stunned me with their ability to exceed my expectations.*********important update***************If I were to do this all over again, I would also consider Klipsch, in the ear, noise cancelling earphones. They only work with music but they are $260.00 less than the Bose headphones. I love my Bose - but I want people who are on a budget to know that an alternative that works quite well, is the Klipsch $40.00, in the ear, noise cancelling earphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Im sure these are great headphones, but as other have commented, the noise cancellation feature put pressure on the eardrums and was unbearable for me after a few minutes.Gave me a great headache.I couldn't get used to it.  Back they go."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bose QC15 vs. Sennheiser PXC 450 vs. Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7bDisclosure: I have tried all these on an airplane. I am not an audiophile. Noise Cancelation is the most important attribute to me.The Carrying Case: All three are quite durable and stiff.1.) Bose- the smallest, a low profile, room for an Ipod, accessories too.2.) Sennheiser- Square shape, low profile, however not a lot of room for anything else in case.3.) Audio Technica- Nice big case if you want to carry extra stuff (Nintendo DS, ipod, etc).Build Quality:1.) Sennheiser- you can tell this is built VERY well. Strong plastics, good components, thick cord. Top notch. You feel like you are getting something really high quality.2.) Audio Technica- Nice solid construction, appears durable.3.) Bose- If this had a Sanyo logo on the side, I would not have flinched. How can something $300 be so incredibly cheaply made.Size:1.) Bose- as far as over the ears go, these are pretty small.2.) Audio-Technica- mid-sized.3.) Sennheiser- These are big. No question, but they store flat.Comfort:1.) Sennheiser- Very comfortable, will fit almost any size ears. Keep on for hours.2.) Bose- Also comfortable. I did not experience ""highs"" discomfort.3.) Audio-Technica- Perfectly satisfactory. Larger opening than previous AT model.  Gets warm and tight on head on long flights.Sound:1.) Sennheiser- I actually wore these at home too, simply to hear parts of songs I had never heard before. Astounding. My 10yr old music collection sounded totally NEW.2.) Audio-Technica- Well balanced, good sound.3.) Bose- Great sound, but very heavy on the bass. I listen to a lot of rap and pop, so it was mildly annoying. I ultimately had to turn my treble settings up on my ipod to balance the sound.Features:1.) Sennheiser- nice cord, push to talk button (temporarily mutes NC and sound which is great for interruptions on airplanes).2.) Bose/Audio Technica- just the basics. Bose simply an on/off switch.Price:1.) Audio Technica- $150 to $225 depending on how you shop.2.) Sennheiser- $200 to $2753.) Bose- Hard to find below $300+.Noise Cancelation:1.) Bose- No question here, far surpassed the other two. Best Noise Cancelation.2.) Audio-Technica- Good Noise Cancelation.3.) Sennheiser- Not sure what happened here. Incredible sound, satisfactory noise cancelation.Summary:I ultimately kept the Bose because I was only using these for flying and the Sennheiser's (as much as I loved them) let me down in the Noise Cancelation department. The Sennheiser's had by far the most superior sound, but the Bose Noise Cancelation was night and day. The Bose are made very poorly for a $300+ product, it was disappointing.Final assessment:Audio-Technica- best balance of value for moneySennheiser- Best sound and comfortBose- Best Noise Cancelation"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Initial Impressions:Construction is mediocre, but not poor.  About what you'd get with phones costing no more than say $100-125.,,, built MUCH better than the headphones that come ith with even the best portable audio players. (of course, you'd expect that!) THOSE types of headphones are worth $15-20 at best!  The two included connecting cords are rather thin but adequate. They are easily attachable/detatchable.  What I DO like is that the cords are replaceable.  One cord is a straight line, like ordinary connecting cord, the other cord includes a microphone, voice command/start/stop button and two volume control buttons. They are both plenty long enough (over 5' long) for normal connections to your iPhone/iPod etc. The headphone end of each connecting cord has a high/low switch for volume... but volume is NOT continuiously variable.Now the PUDDING!  Listening!First the sound quality in any room setting is very good, but not excellent.  It's comparable to headphones costing lno more than $125-150.  The reason I bought these is for when I know that I'll be in a noisy environment... such as in an aircraft or perhaps a bowling alley during tournament nights... etc. Thes headphones blow away the competition when it comes to noise reduction (the proper term is &#34;noise CANCELLATION&#34;)  Before I retired 3 years ago, (early retirement!) I worked as a tecjhnician and had to know about audio and acoustics (even harmonics).Noise cancellation works on the principal that if you combine two identical signals of equal amplitude BUT opposite polarity, the audio signal will be cancelled out. There are TWO microphones on each ear cup, one outside and one INSIDE.  The one outside samples the sounds around you and reduces lower frequencies, such as that from jet engines.  it generates identical frequencies at the same amplitude SPL (sound pressure level) in reverse polarity. The microphone iniside the earcup samples the sound insiide and through DSP (digital signal processing)  smooth out the higher frequencies"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Best of Headphones in the market! These headphones are the right stuff for traveling. Recommend for air travel and anything else where you want to filter noise and concentrate in your business.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've used Sony's MDR-NC60's and liked them, but they were never that great. The ableplanet Linx Audio worked well, but were uncomfortable on my ears. It also had a poorly placed on/off switch that could be easily turned on while being stored. I really like the comfort of Sony's MDR-NC60 (which is now discontinued) and the closest model is the Sony MDR-NC500D, but it's $400 and has less than stellar reviews. I took a chance on the Bose QuietComfort 15, and I LOVE them! They are actually more comfortable than the Sony's, and the noise cancellation and sound quality blows the other two brands out of the water. I'm very pleased and I wouldn't hesitate from buying these if you want the ""perfect"" noise canceling headphones for work and travelling."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are top notch.  Expensive, yes, but worth the money.  The sound quality is crystal clear, and the noise cancellation is not equalled by anything on the market.  I can not believe how well these cancel surrounding noise.  If you work in a cubicle with background noise, or similar, you will love these things.  I would agree that these don't over enhance the bass like some other headphones, but these provide a very realistic sounding experience.  I also appreciate how nice of a case these come in, and the quality of the product.  I'm very happy with these and would recommend to others."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These were a birthday gift for a very deserving teen grandson / musician.  I've used them for years for air travel - there are none as good.  Bose commits highway robbery price-wise, but produce the finest product, and so I keep returning to the trough, smiling and grumbling."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I so wanted to like these headphones. The NC feature is just amazing, and I take a long commute to work. Just like other people have pointed out, some sensitive people might get dizzy or headaches from use of the product. It's a shame, really, because I love the product. I realize it's not for me and I may not be able to wear any NC headphone without feeling ill. My suggestion is try them out before committing. Note: Trying them for 10 minutes at the store is not enough time to catch this rare side effect.You can buy them and try them out, and if you develop this make sure you return them ASAP to get your money back. I know I will."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,First let me say my Bose In The Ear Headphones and Regular non Noise Cancelling Headphone are things I would not leave home without.  I was hoping to get even better from the Bose 15.  First off even though the noise cancelling is perfect It leaves you with a Big headache even when on the ground like after you've been on a long flight on an airplane.  Second Off it takes 1 AAA battery and won't run without it.  third there I no switch to turn off the noise canceling and not have to use the battery.  those are the bad though I would get it out of the way first.The sound quality is just okay for $300.00 I though the sound quality would be a lot better.  the big reason to get these headphones is if you need the Noise Cancelling part and don't mind the headache  for that reason because they are the best at keeping sound out they get three stars.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"In the past when looking for noise canceling or noise reduction headphones or ear buds I shied away from the Bose because of price opting for cheaper alternatives. What with not being happy with any of them for differing reasons I finally decided to step up to the plate and give the Bose QuietComfort's a try. What the heck, I thought, I can always return them if I don't like them. Well, I'm happy to say that won't be the case.The Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones not only do an excellent job of blocking out the noise but also deliver exceptional sound quality. A recent trip to and from the US to Perth, Australia I got the wear them for an extended period of time (about 21 hours each way). They were extremely comfortable; I didn't have to crank up the sound to listen to my movies because of their excellent noise canceling capabilities; and, when not listening to music or movies they allowed me to rest and sleep peacefully as a result of their comfort and them blocking out the noise. I am now a firm believer that these are one of the best if not the best noise canceling headphones available, especially for travelers.Bottom line, don't sit on the fence about spending the money to buy these versus a cheaper alternative. I can assure you, you won't regret buying them!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tried many different types of headphones and earbuds. Looking for the best quality audio response and and noise cancelling.These headphones just work for me.Pros- Great quality audio and noise canceeling, Lighweight. Easy to useCons - No Android phone adapter (works only on Iphone). Audio not the loudest I've heard. Price."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Glad Bose dropped the price in 8/13. Maybe they are coming out with a new model. This one is so good, I don't know what they could do the make it better. Very clear and they are the king of noise canceling when flying. They are not completely flat but my personal taste is to leave the EQ on iTunes off when using them. Lots of options. I've tried a number of high end cans and there is no comparison. Yes, they require a good battery to use them. So put another AAA in the case and you are ready for another 30 hrs. This is because they probably use a DSP that not only does the NC but also tailors (EQ) the signal to make the speakers they use really perform well. Don't fight it, just enjoy the magic. The iPhone mic cable works fine too. Nothing fancy. Play/pause and volume. The mic in the cable works well and can be used for other apps using a mic like a dictation app. It's one of the only mics that allow my deep voice to work with Siri. It appears that you can also purchase adapters that allow this cable to work with other phone makes."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This product only has 1366 reviews so it's in desperate need of another one.Seriously, this goes out to all the older folks. You know who you are.For years I used really cheap headphones, the kind you can buy for $10 or so. Why? Because I'm cheap. Deal with it.As I got older my hearing got worse (don't laugh you youngsters, it'll happen to you too).  I finally gave in and got hearing aids and they help a lot but in some ways they work too well. I'm hearing things I've never heard before and it's annoying if you're trying to listen to music or watch a movie (I use a Roku device).I finally took a few bills out from under my mattress and bought this product. I figured I'd give it a try and if it didn't live up to the reviews then good old Amazon would be getting a return. No way I'd return these!  The noise cancelling feature is wonderful. Put them on, turn them on and you can hardly hear yourself speak let alone anyone else and kiss any ambient noise goodbye. On top of that the sound coming out of these is amazing. I never knew what I was missing.  Because I wear hearing aids I really had to jack the volume down on my iPod/iPad and TV.I also like the compactness. You can fold them up and put them in the nice carrying case that comes with the headphones. I haven't had the opportunity to use these on an airplane but I have no doubt I wouldn't hear the roar of the engine or the person sitting next to me. I have used them outdoors near a busy highway - wait, highway? what highway? I saw cars but they didn't make any noise.My only regret is that I didn't buy these or something like them a long time ago."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Too many people are critical of these headphones because they claim the music sound is not good enough for their tastes.  No one really criticizes the noise canceling feature, but some say there is not enough bass.  I disagree.  THese headphones are superior to any others on the market and provide all the sound quality one could ask for.  I've had many, many headphones over the years and I can say that none even come close to these in sound quality.  Depending on the music one listens to, these headphones will provide a sound experience like none other.  Speaking for my own collection, I can appreciate the instrumentals and the lyric songs as never before.The product arrived at my house and I immediately started listening to my iPod and even purchased a few new songs to round out my collection.  The headphones come with a sturdy case, an airplane adapter jack, a battery, and two cables.  One cable is supposedly for Apple products though I'd be hardpressed to tell the difference.  The only way I knew one was for Apple is because it was labeled as such.  I kept it in my case even when listening to my iPad and iPod.You can probably tell I'm not an audio expert, but I do believe these are the best product on the market and no one is even close to competing with Bose.  I do appreciate music as my primary source of technological entertainment (reading is still tops on my list) so a good set of headphones is critical for me.  The noise cancelling finally drowns out the television, annoying kids, and even my wife.  With that in mind, who could complain?I looked at these for months in the electronics store, viewed Youtube videos, read consumer reports before I made my purchase.  I can afford them but still they cost $300.  I hemmed and hawed, repeated my research and finally thought that I had waited long enough.  I wish I had made up my mind far earlier.  THese are excellent headphones and I look forward to many hours of music enjoyment with them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these to drown out noisy neighbors. Very surprised that I couldn't hear all the noise associated with them moving in above me. I could feel the vibrations of the furniture moving, but not hear it. I'm very impressed."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I generally use these when I travel.  I'm not the type who walks around with earbuds or headphones on; I like to engage with the world around me.  However; when on an airplane or in a terminal they are great for either listening to music or just to deaden the surrounding sounds.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Ok, it's a clever trick - you don't realize how much a/c noise or whatever is around until these cancels it, and it's quite astonishing when it goes away.  Woo-hoo, pass them around your friends.But...  They don't actually /sound/ any good.  Loud bass, which pleases the crowds, but musically they're just downright bad.  Next to any half-way decent headphones they produce muffled, lifeless music.  Listen to the strumming of a guitar and it's just tones with none of the rich acoustic texture.And also, they don't cut out a lot of the distractions you might hope to lose, like conversations etc..  They just reduce the fatigue of background noise.  If you spend a lot of time on airplanes, don't care much about music and don't care to travel light, perhaps they're a reasonable idea.If they sounded good they'd have 5 stars from me, but they don't, and they're very expensive.Background noise reduction 9/10, distraction reduction 4/10, musical quality 2/10...I'll be sticking with my Etymotic HF5 headphones and sending these back even though they were given to me for free by my employer.  One third the price, small and neat, and for better or worse they act like earplugs - they cut out the background noise *and* conversations leaving only the music, reproduced in a lyrical, textured, detailed way."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Excellent product , would buy again if i get the money. Based on the product title, it is extraordinary in acoustic noise cancelling of course. I don;t have complaint on other aspects."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are certainly great for the traveler who wants relief from engine noise.  Consider, however, those who just want to sit in front of their computers and get away from the world - all the while listening to their favorite Mozart (or insert your own choice of entertainment).  For that purpose, you can't get much better than the QC15s - with outstanding sound and feather-weight comfort. And, if you simply want to get away from it all, you can just ""click"" them on to enjoy the silence.  They really are ""noise cancelling"".  Sure, they don't have the very serious ""cans"" of the more elite headphones, but they do produce top quality sound - and I would challenge the majority of user's ears to find better. As to build-quality, hey don't knock them because they have some plastic components - not everything has to be built of airplane-grade aluminum alloy.  My only gripe (a small one) - don't run out of batteries - or you will be sporting some very interesting earmuffs!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It's really comfortable and good NC technology,a little high in price but I think it's worth it.But it's maybe not as comfotable as AE2,maybe cuz it's NC section"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am not a fan of Bose, I was a little reluctant to purchase these as some reviews say they are have a cheap finish.  But I must say they are very well put together and the carry case is nicely finished.  Noise cancelling is excellent, we have a very loud AC unit in our room, switched the NC on and it just went quiet...amazing. The sound quality is very good also, very surprised.  Expensive? yes, but they are for listening to music in a loud environment... Wish I had purchased these a long time ago."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"What can I say. Bose products cost more , but one gets a lot more than just a product. I owned a pair of Bose noise cancelling head phones that were over 5 years old. The Quiet Comfort 15 replaces the old ones I have. A year ago I snapped the ear muff frame on one side and decided just to glue them...worked for 6 months and the glue gave way. Glued them again and a month later they broke again. I was ready to buy another pair and decided to call Bose to see if they had a replacement program for headphones similar to the Bose 901 speaker replacement that I took advantage of 10 years ago. Score!!!  Bose has a replacement program for my old headphones( Gorilla glue and all) ...they are being replaced by the Quiet Comfort 15s for $99 + applicable sales tax and around $5 shipping."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"...kind of cheaply constructed.I listen mostly to jazz & chill/house & the sound quality is good enough (I like good sound but I'm not an audiophile.)I hear a lot of nuances that I don't notice when playing my iPod Classic through a set of Logitech s715i external speakers.The bass is not quite as heavy as I like but overall the sound quality is good.The lack of bass is not so noticeable with easy listening but when I play something like Led Zeppelin it bothers me a bit.I use an FiiO E5 amplifier (an excellent little amp) to boost the bass to acceptable levels for heavier listening.The biggest gripe I have is the flimsy construction.The battery cover feels like it will break off if you aren't careful.Also where the cord plugs into the headphones it feels a bit weak.With the reputation Bose has for quality; you'd think they would have made these headphones a bit more solid.The comfort factor is good & they are small enough to store in a Swiss Army bag I carry on flights so I don't have to go into the overhead for items I frequently need.These cans will heat your ears up a little bit but not nearly as much as my Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones which make my ears sweat.The cord has volume & track changing buttons which are reasonably easy to use.I've received phone calls on my iPhone while listening to music & had no problems using the controls to switch to incoming calls.Calls are crystal clear & you can still hear your own voice (diminished) as you talk.The buttons are at the top of the cord near the headphones & although I'd prefer they were lower down, it isn't a huge annoyance.You'll need to use a single AAA battery which lasts for quite a while.Unfortunately you can't listen to the headphones without the battery.Overall; I bought these for noise reduction & they definitely excel in this department.I fly a lot & my Audio Technica ATH-M50's allowed entirely too much engine noise through for my listening enjoyment.Granted the ATH-M50's are not noise canceling headphones but if you want premium sound quality & aren't concerned with noise reduction then you should get a pair of the Audio Technica headphones instead of the Bose as they have vastly superior sound quality & they are available at $100 to $125 as opposed to $300 for the QC-15's.==========Update==========I just made my 1st flight with these headphones & WOW; what a difference over the ATH-M50's!These headphones don't get rid of ALL the noise but what they don't filter out is barely noticeable while listening to music.When we were sitting at the gate with only one engine running at idle; I turned the headphones on with no music & almost everything disappeared.I could still hear announcements on the intercom & conversations around me but they were greatly diminished.When I started playing music; I could barely hear the intercom or the conversations of other passengers.I turned on my iPod again as the engines were spinning up for takeoff & heard almost nothing but music!!!It appears as though the noise cancelation works best on continuous sounds like jet engines, etc.Intermittent sounds like conversations or someone using a hammer (the latter rarely happens on an airplane) are subdued but not canceled entirely; which means you'll still be aware of important events onboard like exploding engines or hijack attempts (see comment regarding hammers.)The results are totally acceptable for all but the most finicky audiophiles.Flimsy construction aside; I highly recommend these headphones if you fly a lot!I believe I'll be selling my ATH-M50's on FeeBay!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these before a long international flight and was very impressed.  The sound quality is good, but the noise cancelling is almost magic.  It almost completely eliminates engine noise when on an airplane.  I also use them in my office to eliminate the noise from the large vent directly above my desk.I was also impressed with the various cables and adapters included with the headphones.  The case also includes a small mesh pocket - presumably for extra batteries, but my ipod Nano fits in their perfectly as well."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Got these as a gift for the hubby to use on the airplane.  One thing we figured out about these, they are really just for cancelling ""background"" noise.  In other words, you can still hear the baby screaming two rows back.  We also tried them at home and we could still hear the kids there too--oh well!  Seriously, these headphones are very nice.We are not savvy enough to use, let alone review, the many techincal aspects of these headphones, but we can definitively say they do work...very well!  Blocking out background noise really makes a BIG difference when listening to your music or movies, especially since they are no longer competing with each other.  The headphones also come with a carrying case and an airline adapter, so they are ready to go out of the box.  Additionally, they are quite comfortable to wear, much more so than the headphones that you stick in your ear canal.The downside to these headphones are that they require batteries to use (noise-cancelling or not), they are fairly large, and man, are they expensive!  You really have to be careful not to leave these at security, or anywhere else for that matter, because you would never see them again.  The upside is that if you can afford them and don't mind keeping up with them, they are a nice little luxury to have, especially if you like sleeping on the plane."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If you are looking for a pair of noise canceling headphones look no further!  I just used these on a weekend trip out of state which included plane, train, and bus.  These headphones blocked out everything and let me read, listen to music, and yes sleep in peace.  Consider the $300 an investment in your sanity and saving yourself some of the headaches of traveling. Even when just laying in bed relaxing, these are great to have on to keep out the AC drone or other noises you don't even notice.  As other reviewers pointed out, the bass is not quite the power of a set of subwoofers and the volume isnt the same as an amplified stereo or other amped headphones but still had a couple clicks left in my mp3 and the bass on some songs was enough to feel the shake on my ears.  Crystal clear audio and great noise canceling capability make these a pair of headphones that I will use as often as I get the chance!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I got the headset for travel and to use at work. On the aircraft, it significantly cuts down on the engine noise. Works as advertised! I can listen to movies at normal volume."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I work in a cube city with very loud neighbors. I put these on and they melt away. They are very comfortable, have a long detachable cord, and I use a rechargeable battery that I change every 2 days (I use it at home when watching TV too)."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've had the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones for about a year now.  These are made well with high quality materials.  Noise cancellation is the best in this price range.Battery life (just one battery only) is superb!  I swap out the battery once a month when I use the headphones on average for about 3-5 hours of the day listening to music.  I use these mostly at work but have taken them with me on business and personal trips.  On trips, the headphones come in a sturdy pouch.  The headphones themselves are pretty light and not overly bulky in my opinion.  The cord used to plug into the music device is plenty long.The headphones are very comfortable with supple padding around the ears and along the top of the head.  You can adjust the headphones as you please but, again, the comfort level is very good.  I didn't feel any uncomfortable pressure around the ears or along the top of my head.  Very light as well so you even forget that you have them on at times.One thing I do notice is that because the insulation around the ears is so good, you can tend to sweat inside the ear casing.  This is AFTER 3-4 hours of continuous listening.  I simply put them off for 5-10 minutes and I was fine afterwards for a few hours of additional listening.I'd highly recommend these headphones for the comfort, sound quality, high quality make/durability, portability, and noise cancellation!  The price is high but for what you get, it's worth it in my opinion!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Ok these are expensive and I can absolutely say that they are completely worth it.  It's funny that these come with cards for the product in the case so you can hand them out.  They are reall that good.I've looked, and tried many other noise cancelling headphones.  I'm always on the lookout for something better and cheaper.  I have not been able to find any other noise cancelling headphones that are as good as these.  They work on planes and in my office building(that sounds like a plane due to the air conditioning).I can clearly hear someone if they talk directly to me, but they tune out all other noises.  I travel from the US to India occasionally and these are life savers.I only wish they had a cordless bluetooth version.Hope I don't ever loose these, but if I do, I'm buying another pair."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Let me start off by saying I've used my QC15s for over three years now, including lots of time on flights, and even more on ocean-going ships.  Needless to say, noise-canceling headphones were a great improvement to my happiness-- and these really do cancel noise.  Flip the switch, and instantly everything goes quiet.  If you wear these on a flight, you can slip into your own little first-class world, right in economy class.  No engine noise, and people don't bother you because you are clearly enjoying a very personal sound experience.  They're pretty much great.They come with a hard case, and they are great quality.  They are trimmed with soft, thin leather that, years later, looks as good as new and is soft as silk, so it feels great around your ears.The sound quality is what you would expect from high end headphones.  It's comparable with studio-grade headsets.  The volume is more than sufficient, and like I said above, the noise-canceling is great.  They do require one AAA battery to operate.My first set quit working after a few months for reasons unknown, so I took them to a local Bose store in a mall.  They were replaced right there, no questions asked, and the replacement pair has worked now for over three years.  So 5 stars for customer service.Five stars because noise canceling is a godsend, the quality is great, and these things improve my quality of life like a set of premium headphones should."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tried these because the Sennheiser Momentum didn't fit my ears.  But once you've heard the sound from the SMs, few can compare, and these just didn't stand up in that department.  Otherwise, they were fine.  Good big ear cups, good build quality, can fold for easy storage and travel, and can keep unwanted sound out like no one's business."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I got these because of some recent flights I took.I put these on, and oh boy did they work awesome.Didn't have to hear the constant drone of the airplane noise.I hate airplane noise.They are very comfortable to wear, had them on for many hours and didn't need to take them off.Very well made, and like that one battery lasts a long time."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"During the last month I purchased both the Sennheiser MM 550-X and the Bose QC-15 headphones. My goal was to find a decent pair of noise canceling headphones to block out ambient noise in my office. I'm keeping the Bose, and sending back the Sennheisers. Here is why:1) The Bose fit my large ears much better. The Sennheisers are just a little too small. They aren't as comfortable.2) The Bose noise canceling is much better. It blocks more ambient noise, and there is no perceptible hiss. The Sennheisers hiss a little when the noise canceling is active.3) The Bose sound better at high volumes. The Sennheisers sound a bit harsh.4) The Bose have better base at all volume levels. The Sennheisers don't have nearly enough.5) I hear crackling with the Sennheisers. At first I thought it was a physical flaw, but it appears to be a software problem. Every time I start listening to a new song in iTunes I hear crackling during the first few seconds of the song. After that it sounds ok. While playing back videos in iMovie, there is crackling at certain points in the video soundtrack. The crackling always occurs at the same point in the video. I don't have this problem with the Bose. I think there must be a problem with the audio encoder used by the Sennheisers. I could maybe overlook my other complaints, but this crackling is awful. It's totally unacceptable for a $500 product.6) The Sennheiser noise canceling briefly cuts out each time I stop music playback in iTunes. It turns off for about half a second, and I can hear a click each time it happens. For a brief moment I can hear all of the fans and office noise around me.Anyway, I'm quite disappointed with the Sennheisers. It's a shame, because I really wanted a pair of wireless headphones. It looks wired is the way to go for now. I'm keeping the Bose.I almost gave the Bose a 5-star review. If they came with a slightly longer cable, and a more sturdy cable, then they would easily be 5-star headphones. However, the cable is a tad short, and it's quite thin.  You can't go wrong with these headphones though. They are the best noise canceling headphones I've ever used."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tend to think Bose products are significantly overpriced. However, I really wanted a quality listening experience. I bought the QC15's in 11/11, after buying/trying a number of alternatives.Pluses:1) Probably the most REALISTIC sound I've heard from headphones. Ever. Bass fiends should look elsewhere. Nonetheless, the bass rumbles, trebles are bright, vocals stand out with very little bias or coloration. Just plain excellent, sound balanced and clear.2) Light and small, probably as small as an over-the-ear model can realistically be.3) Easy to wear for 4 hour stretches since they sit on your skull instead of on your ear structures.4) Noise cancelling is truly effective. Makes the world go away. I have never heard the pumping/breathing others have reported.5) What's especially cool is the sound seems to float in space, as there's virtually no background noise to reference.Minuses:1) Baby this unit. It's reasonably robust, but my impression is designers biased the build toward lightweight and it is more delicate than your average cans.2) Case is ok for normal travel, but not sufficient if a overhead carry on bag hits it.3) You may have to pony up $30+ for cord compatible with Android or Blackberry microphone. Comes with iPhone microphone cord and straight 3.5mm headphone only. I was able to use both with my Android and avoid the extra cost.Other:No AC unit to keep ears cool on hot day.Music dies with battery is a non-issue. How is it to carry extra AAA in the case?"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I love these noise canceling headphones and have been a long time user of a Bose QC2. I recently upgraded to the QC15 and it has the same great comfortable feel with even better noise canceling. I do fly around a fair bit and the Bose are equivalent to a free class upgrade. Definitely worth it for the comfortable fit and wonderful performance. Prior to the QC2 I had tried a number of different options but after my experience with the QC2 I am sticking with Bose.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My last set of Bose QC's was version 2.These are hand's down the best yet.I travel for a living.It's one thing to fly on a plane that has 50 movies; it's another to actually be able to hear the audio.Face it, airline headphones suck; even in first class.These don't."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"They don't come any better.  The main thing to note if you buy a pair is that they come equipped with many of the items also sold separately, e.g., the case."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"As other reviewers have stated, the active noise cancelling does work well.  Background white noise disappears, voices are diminished and become distant.  It is also very comfortable for extended listening sessions.  I do not perceive the ""ear drum pressure"" that some reviewers mentioned.However, for me, sound quality is just as important.  In this regard, the headphones sound decent but not befitting a $300 price tag.  My in-ear monitors,Monster Copper Turbine PRO Headphones with ControlTalk, has excellent detailed sound that is a couples of notches above the Bose, and has excellent passive noise isolation as well."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Tested out the new Beats Studio and thought they sounded great with good noise cancellation.  But then I tried a pair of the Quietcomfort 15 and was blown away by the difference in NRA and sound quality.  Even without the music playing I could immediately hear pure silence (aside from muffled voices) and when I took them off I was amazed at much low end noise there is in my office from the HVAC system and my space heater.  Music quality was also very clear without the heavy bass influencing the songs like the Beats did.  The only negatives I have are that the plastic quality could by better and have a rechargeable battery like the Beats.  I did get the Brown limited edition version and this helps to make it look a little more like the $300 price tag if carries.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones sound great and they have excellent noise cancellation on low-frequency sounds, especially fan noises or airplane noises. However, I intended to study with these but had to return them because unfortunately they do not block out higher frequency noises such as voices or paper shuffling. I wanted these to block out all noise so I could study in a coffee shop, but unfortunately a pair of cheap ear plugs performs better for this function. One thing I do not like about the cables Bose uses is that they are high impedance. I know they have a higher low setting, but even the low impedance setting is quite high and therefore I have to crank up the volume on an iPhone to achieve normal listening levels, I would say about 75 to 100% volume depending on the song. Another gripe I had was that considering the price of these headphones, the plugs or not gold coated so when you rotate the plug in an iPhone or computer, you get some distortion noises common on cheap headphones due to poor contact or transmission. Sound quality is on par with high-quality headphones such as the Dr. Dre beats Pro and Grado SR80i. I would agree with many other reviewers that these headphones have a good bass response but they're not for bass lovers. The bass is accurate, but you cannot really get a booming or bass thumping feel from them. The extra cable for iPhone remote microphone control is excellent, but I did not have an opportunity to test call quality with the inline microphone. The inline remote microphone also work with Apple computers. Unfortunately these did not fill my purpose, so I had to return them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"What can I say? These are as near perfect as can be.  I purchased these for one of my sons a while ago, and he is a real music aficionado, and suggested that I purchase one for my other son.  Since it was close to my birthday, I indulged in one for myself.  All three of us are amazed at the sound of the music, and are also amazed at the fact that all external noise is blocked out.  I can't wait to use these on the plane; and they come in extremely handy when I am sitting in the family room reading while my husband watches TV (with the volume up, nonetheless).So, yes I would recommend them, and yes I would purchase them again (maybe for my third son, even though he is a minimalist and prefers ear-buds. =)One more thing- they came much sooner than expected (in a day or two) in PERFECT condition."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Sound quality is great, however, bass is too low in my opinion.Everyone can hear whatever you are listening too at average volume. I can't use these in a library or anywhere where complete silence is needed.not too happy about the inline mic not working with android (Galaxy s3). Wish bose would just give you the option of which type of cable comes with the headset.For this cable, Only the button works(not the volume rocker). I hear the communication kit works (but no button and that is an extra $30... no thanks).Excited to use it on my next trip! would recommend it for noise cancellation."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I have used it whenever i am traveling. and i also use it whenever i am in the middle of annoying crowded people. LOL no doubt i dont know what they are talking because what i am hearing is the music i am playing on my IPOD. I love this headphone much
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"WOW - what more can I say. This product does as advertised, but so has all of my other Bose products. Background noise is almost completely eliminated when not connected to an electronic device. When listening to anything at all, all exterior noise is gone. I slept like a baby on the 8.5 hour flight to Germany with no tactile discomfort whatsoever. Additionally, if you need to make a phone call in a noisy environment the headphones help with that as well. They come with a cable that facilitates control of Apple products. I'm very satisfied with this slightly expensive purchase. They are worth the price."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I have tried many head phones ... bose QF 15 is the best of all my collections. very comfortable and the noise cancelling function  was very effective. I love using them when I fly and normally I wear it for 12 to 15 hours when travelling. for that price I would say worth the money.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"First off, I'm a headphone person.  I've owned 3 pairs of noise reduction headphones in the last 10 years.  The first pair I owned was a Sennheiser pcx250, which had minimal noise reduction.  After several years of use, I decided to upgrade in 2008 and tried out the Bose QC2 and Sennheiser PCX 450.  The Bose had better noise reduction, but worse sound quality than the PCX 450.  I wanted to like the PCX 450; however, I kept noticing a weird low frequency ringing that would occur while moving my head wile wearing the PCX 450.  Ultimately I kept the Bose QC2 after about a week long trial of the QC2 and PCX 450.Well after almost 5 years of rather regular use of the QC2 while watching TV and listening to my iPhone at home (I live in an apartment) and listening to music on travel, my QC2 headphone pads started to fail.  One of the ear cushions tore due to regular use and the headband pad was starting to peel.  I live fairly close to a Bose factory store, and went in to buy a replacement pair of QC2 ear cushions for $35 (this would have been my second replacement cushion set, I had already replaced them about 2 years ago).  The clerk told me that the failed ear cushions entitled me to an upgrade of my QC2 to a new pair of QC15 for only $99.  I was skeptical, but I went home, got my QC2 and went back to the store and for $99 did indeed trade in my QC2 for a new pair of QC15.  Great deal considering the cushions would have cost $35 alone.On to the review of the QC15 (probably reflected in many other reviews)...  I've been using the QC2's regularly as I stated before, so I can comment directly on the relative improvement of the QC15's.  The QC15 noise reduction is great.  Much, much better than my old pair of QC2 (some of which may be just due to the worn ear cushions).  There is much more noise reduction at low frequencies.  My HVAC noise, which used to be audible with the QC2's, is not audible and footfalls from the apartment above are also not audible while wearing the QC15's.  Given my initial trial of the QC2 and PCX 450's, I can also say that the QC15 noise reduction is likely much better than the 450's as well.  Sound quality of the QC15's is also noticeably better than the QC2's.  Highs are brighter and crisper but lows may not be boosted as much (which I am fine with).  Others may find the lack boosted lows annoying, I do not.  I have not traveled with the QC15's yet, so I cannot comment on their performance on board aircraft.  However, I am guessing they should be rather good.I have a pair of Sennheiser HD 650's at work that I use occasionally to listen to music (they own them so I don't bring them home, spectacular sound quality).  I highly recommend the HD 650's if you don't need noise reduction.  The QC15's don't really compare to the sound quality of the HD650's in a quiet environment, but if you have to listen to music in a moderately noisy environment the QC15's are a good bet.  Overall, sound quality of the QC15's is somewhere in between the QC2 and Sennheiser HD 650's.  I'd bet they are on par with (or very close to) the Sennheiser PCX 450's, but with better noise reduction.  That means, if you are forced to be in a noisy environment, you can listen to your content without as many noticeable distractions."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I finally broke down and bought these after talking about for a year.  It was the best decision ever.  I just used them for the first time on a trip to LA and I'm headed to London today and can't wait to use them.  I find that it helps me arrive at my destination far more refreshed because I don't have the constant noise of the aircraft or the people around me.  Not only do these headphones work, they are super comfortable, which is a win/win.  You won't regret this purchase."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've owned two pairs of the Bose NC headphones. Both failed out of warranty. The first pair the ear pads fell off because the glue failed and became mushy. Called the factory and was told tough,out of warranty. Bad attitude from their employee. I bought a replacement pair and now they have failed-out of warranty of course. For $300 they should last. Some manufactures and I'm not saying this is the case here,deliberately build in a weak part that will fail and force you to buy another one. In this set there is a very tiny wire just inside the battery compartment that is flexed every time the battery is replaced. This wire will fatigue and snap after 50-100 battery change outs. Its another ( got ya) in other wise a good product. Open yours up and inspect the wire. If any of the wire strands are broke try to resolder and good luck.  A maybe fix before it breaks is to carefully coat the wire with Marine Goop. Use a small tooth pick to cover the wire. Goop is available at Lowes in the paint dept.For the built in failure modes I gave this company a 1 star."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I was a division one athlete and was thus required to travel frequently. I used these mostly to allow for sleep on trips. These work great on bus, car, plane (jet and prop) noise cancellation. Even allowed for 8 hours of sleep on a flight to Beijing. The sound cancellation works only on constant noises ie engine noise and allows the user to have a conversation without removing the headphones. When these are used to play music the sound quality is excellent and almost no external sounds can be heard. I have had these two years and have never had an issue with them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these in April - been looking at them for a long time but the $300 price tag put me off for a set of headphones.I have very acute hearing and my husband doesn't.  I wanted to be able to sit with him while he watched television and I could read quietly.  I don't listen to much music so bought it primarily for the noise cancelling feature.  When I read all the great reviews about how these headphones could block out the roaring of a jet engine, figured this was the ticket.My husband put them on and even with his slightly impaired hearing, he could hear the sounds in the house and the television.  It doesn't block out any sounds for me either.I wrote to Bose five or six times and they didn't have any suggestions.  As for the music, I have three pairs of $6.78 EarPollution Plugz - and I don't think the Bose is any better than they are.If anyone has any suggestions as to what may be wrong with this pair we bought, I'd appreciate hearing from you.  I feel like we wasted $300 on something that doesn't have any more value than a throw-away pair.I wish I had something positive to write.  Most of my reviews are 5 stars but I'm going with a 1 on this one.  For those entertaining buying a pair, I'd suggest going to a store to try them before parting with your money.Update on May 27, 2012:Hi, Denia - and thanks for the two other suggestions that replied to my post.I've been emailing back & forth with Bose direct - and one tech support person asked me to try all kinds of things - up to and including running the dishwasher and standing in front of the washing machine. My husband & I both did that - and we had our help who is 1/2 our age do the same - and all three of us could hear the sounds. I thought they would help us and then I received this email from a different person - with a different twist:""Sorry for any confusion. The Quiet Comfort headset is designed specifically for frequent flyers. The technology is desgined to cancel out the constant low frequency tones of an airline engine. It does NOT cancel out every day ambient sounds such as children playing, dogs barking, tv audio, human voices (conversations in the back ground), or anything like that. In fact, I have a pair on right now, and I can hear the two people taking in the cubicle right next to me, very clearly. This is normall (sic).  Now, other customers use the headset for great audio reproduction while listening to their music, but the noise cancellation is designed to cancel out constant low frequency noises. The dishwasher and washing machine sounds are too intermittent to work, that would not tell you anything.Sorry if you thought the headset would work for your individual situation. It won't block out tv audio at all. If you bought the headset directly from Bose, less than 30 days ago, you can return them by calling 800-444-2673.

Big waste of money. Thought if it could block out the sound of a jet engine it would certainly be capable of blocking out the noise of a television set.I'll write to Bose again when ""Barry"" the tech was working and see if he can help me after the 3-day holiday is over.Perhaps putting disclaimer on this item - no where did I read that it was designed exclusively for noise cancelling - only for jets. I'll read the literature again; maybe I missed that section.I'd rate these a 1 if this is the case. $300 is a lot of money to spend on something that says ""noise cancelling"" - but only includes jet engine noise. If that's the case then that should be specifically stated. I'll write to the president of Bose and see if I can get some help from the top. Don't know unless you ask.As for any others looking for ""noise cancelling"" headsets, I strongly suggest going to a store and trying them before purchasing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"What blew me away about these headphones initially was the demo at the store where you s stand under a wind tunnel and this headset deadens the hurricane sound to nothing. For some reason, it's been less impressive in real life.My previous set - a Sony - was absolutely quieter...so quiet that a crying baby in a plane could be shut out.  The Bose headset is comfortable for long durations, more so than the Sony, which clenches the ears and covers the ears more and gets uncomfortable after a couple of hours.The Bose is also useless without a battery. So always have a spare."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones really get you rested well in flight.  I always travel on business class and many business class seats nowadays offer noise-cancelling headphones.  Bose still works a lot better.I also find myself more rested when I have them on.Sleeping in it on a long-haul flight may be a bit difficult because it is quite large.  I sleep on my back but when I turn on my side while asleep, I wake up because the headphones get in the way.I always travel with an extra battery in the case as it could drain fast depending on use."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought a pair of the original Bose noise cancelling headphones in 2004.  They were very good and lasted me 5 years of daily use before one of the arms cracked.  I called Bose and was told I was out of warranty but that they'd sell me a brand new pair of QC2's for 1/3 of the retail cost.  I took them up on it and was very happy for the next 3 years until the foam around the left earpiece came loose.  I called Bose again, and they offered to sell me a set of the QC15's for less than half the retail cost.  To me this felt like excellent service.  I'm very happy.The QC15s are much better than the QC2's.  Noise cancellation is excellent and music sounds great.  I couldn't be happier.  I happily would have paid retail price for these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these a few months ago to use mainly during air travel to listen to my own music (iPhone) and to listen to ""quiet"" on long trips.  These headphone have been a horror story from the beginning.  Bottom line:  they shorted out my iPhone entirely - meaning I've seen that iPhone do everything from displaying a rainbow of colors to just about self-destructing, and the Apple genious folks had a hard time getting it reprogrammed.  I've also had a Bose entertainment system that has been back to the factory 5 times (each time it cost $130 plus shipping) for repairs, the last time being after the power supply shorted and melted and the plastic outer cover ran down my living room wall.  Needless to say, I've had a very expensive lesson - just about a grand - that Bose simply does not build very good stuff!  Most quality companies will make any repair or adjustment necessary to satisfy a customer but Bose apparently does not feel that customer satisfaction is part of a good business plan."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Having owned and used these for a couple months now, I am far from impressed given the exorbitant cost.  I have owned Bose speakers before.  I have purchased three sets of Companion 2 Series 2 speakers for different computers.  I loved those, so I figured I would give these a try and I had high expectations given the price and brand.  First of all, the general build quality is good, however then you get into the cord.  The detachable cord is flimsy and cheap at best.  Honestly I wish there was an option to buy a pair with a fixed cord, they are detachable so you can add the iPhone compatible microphone cable.  Regardless, this cable is cheap.  Second, its hard to get good sound balance from these because of the alternating high/low control on the cord (its on the piece that slips into the headphones).The noise cancellation is average.  What is rather unpleasant about the noise cancelling besides that it only blocks out ambient noise, not voice or direct noise, is that it also feels like its muffling my ear drums.  Its the same feeling as putting in ear plugs and diving underwater, and I don't enjoy it.  It's less noticeable when you're listening to music/movies or playing a game.Also the headphone do not work without the noise cancelling turned on.  That means you need to keep a spare AAA battery with you (required for use) in case the one currently in the headset runs out.Overall, I would probably not purchase these again."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought as a replacement for some stolen ones - bought exactly the same again, no hesitation. they really are good."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My sister bought the QC15 headphones by trading the QC3 in and only paid $100. If she paid the 300, I would give it a three stars. The QC15s block outside noise well, usually drones like a fan or a jet engine's whine are what blocks the best. The sound quality are better than my in-ear Skull Candy headphones. That being said, for $300, I'm confidant in saying you can for sure get better sounding headphones. That being said, these are perfect for traveling since the noise cancelling is good. You could also use in-ear but many don't like them. These however if used as daily use, eats up batteries pretty fast. I can't say on reliability since I've only had them for a month but our family used the QC3 for around 6-7 years and the only issue was the leather ear cups that degraded however it was an easy and cheap fix. I'd rather see these on peoples heads then seeing these over hyped Beats headphones however for $300, get a Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, or Grado.Summary - Great for traveling or noise cancelling applications. If you want to use at home for music, there are better options.Pro - Over the ear is superior, Noise Cancelling works fairly well, no complaints on audio quality, great for travel, good fit.Cons - Not the best for the money, eats batteries, noise leaks out once you go over 20%."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I am Very happy with this headset. Like the fact that it takes a regular battery and lasts a long time. It is very comfortable on the ears and I use them frequently when I travel. These are the best noise canceling headphones I have ever owned which was the reason I bought them in the first place. Other headsets may beat them in sound quality but I am not an audiophile but I still found these to be excellent with my plain old IPOD.  The semi hard case is top notch. You get what you pay for.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Amazing sound quality and the noise cancellation feature is pretty awesome! My first rel set of acoustic noise cancelling headphones and it was worth the money!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Good but not great - you can still hear some noise coming through on an airplane but works very well in a library!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"A quite expensive, but worth it!The noise cancelling is AWESOME, it cancels almost every sound but not too much the high-pitched noises like women voices but still makes it really low. The only con is that you feel like if you were at the bottom of a pool, weird at the beginning but you will enjoy your music and get used to. Actually the best in the market. Another bad thing is that it will be so quiet and crystal clear that if you have bad quality songs you will know it and hate those songs, you will skip them!Sound is superb, crystal clear and balanced(Maybe not too much bass, if you want bass go with Beats or Rock equalizer). There are some others headphones that sound a bit better but you won't even notice(this doesn't mean these sound bad, actually the sound is pretty good, REALLY good).Construction is plastic is GREAT, i don't have nothing to complain on those headphones about construction they feel really good and strong, just a bit large, but still looks cool. The headphones are big, not for tiny heads like childs even in the smaller size(it will fall off or move). The cable is strong but is a bite long, a bit longer than the normal lenght so you will have to get rid of the lenght. By the way, REALLY COMFORTABLE.Love the AAA battery can replace it really easy, you can buy it everywhere and it's cheap or use an rechargeable one; the QC3 uses an lithium special battery (expensive and you will need to buy an extra one or replace it someday, and if you go out of charge you are done, no more music.)The case is pretty fine, hard but a bit big. I don't even use it, i'm always wearing those headphones. It has a little bag for batteries it has a velcro behind so you can take it down or turn it.You get an extra cable (with remote for apple products), airplane adapter, and a bunch of courtesy cards if someone ask you about these headphones.I don't have complains about the headphones i love them! I've had Senheisser, Bose, Sony, a BUNCH of headphones, normal ones (and in-ear) and cancelling ones.Maybe a bit expensive but worth it. By the way, Amazon customer service was great, i didn't receive the headphones at first, they were really helpful and fast! 1 minute after i opened the claim and was resolved, the send me a new ones! Received them the next day!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love my quiet times, when I take a break from the noisy, hectic world to focus on what really matters to my soul. It may be painting, meditating, viewing YouTube videos, listening to music... any one of those are greatly enhanced by the use of my Bose noise canceling headphones that my niece bought for me. One of my most highly valued gifts! Great quality, great value - not cheap, but very much worth the investment in yourSELF."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The headphone is more than what I expected, excellent sound quality, real noise canceling, conformable on the ears, great value."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I wasn't expecting a 100% noice cancelling level, but maybe 75-80%... well, I still can heard my neighbors talking, and they're not even screaming... quite disappointed."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'll never fly without these again. Period. There's really nothing else to say, but Amazon is requiring this last sentence."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones distort at high volumes and sound flat when using for playback in a recording studio.They barely reach a satisfactory high volume level when listening to music on an iPhone or iPod.  Even with the high settings on the earphone plug that jacks into the earphone.Noise canceling works well for wanting some quiet while reading.Beats by Dre studio sound incredible on iPhone, iPod and via playback through sound card in my home recording studio, however they too distort but only at the 8 -10 max range on volume; they have a fuller sound from 1-8 volume setting (low to three quarters of the way up)The Bose are comfortable and clear but the clarity and sparkle just isn't there as they are with the beats by dre studios.I'm still a big fan of Bose (surround speaker system) but they need some improvements in tuning these headphones for better sound."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Best headphone I have ever owned but they are severely missing some bass. When I say some I mean some, even a little would be appreciated but they have almost no bass what so ever.The noise cancelling is very effective, on flights I often just have them on with no music playing just so that I can get some quiet.If you listen to music that thrive on good bass then I would not recommend these.But if you don't care about bass then any other headset would be the wrong choice!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I decided to cheap out earlier and bought a pair of Sony NR headsets for $30 and change. They seemed pretty good but on flights, the NR wasn't good enough - way too much background noise. Finally I decided to man up and get the real deal. And boy, what a change (for the better)!With the Bose headsets, NR means NR, they ain't kidding about when they say NR, absolutely no background noise on the flight. My quick thoughts on this so far:- You haven't heard true HD sound if you haven't heard it on this headset.  And the sound is not like bass or treble heavy, it's just crisp and you can hear every water drop and every single instrument being played. And NR works great both ways on this headset - the surrounding noise is almost cancelled out completely for you when you're using the headsets, and the sound of the sound from the headset doesn't carry out of the headsets either. I can listen to music or movies at a fairly high volume and the person sitting next to me won't hear a thing.- The leather trim around the headsets makes them extremely comfortable to wear. I wear them on 15-hour flights and don't feel any strain by the end of the flight. My ears or head don't hurt because of the headsets and the plastic strap. They truly are made for comfort.- It comes with airplane adapter so you can turn it from a single 3.5mm audio cable into one that fits in the airplane sockets. The cable is also detachable completely from the headset, which I actually find very useful when I want to doze off and not be bothered by surrounding noise. You don't realize how effective the headsets are till you take them off and realize how much of background noise they were eliminating!- The only one downside of this headset is that it runs on a AAA battery. So I always need to make sure I have fully charged batteries with me at all times. I carry rechargeable batteries (Sanyo Eneloop are the BEST) with a charger. So if I do run out of battery, I can always charge it on the flight itself. ON a full charge of the Eneloop AAA,  I am yet to run out of battery on a 15-hour flight.Yes, these headsets aren't cheap but they are worth every penny. Bose puts so much research and effort into developing their products, I have absolutely no reason to complain!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I Bought these for noise cancellation and was not disappointed. They are also very durable considering that they are lightweight and comfortable. Since I can't afford a Lexus I just put these on and use my imagination. These were purchased in September of 2009 and the only problem with them so far (April 2012)is the ear pads wore out. Since replacement pads are available from Bose this was not an issue.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had settled for a number of years with another brand which was supposedly nearly as good for roughly half the price.  Yet when I bought these, I realized what I had been missing.  Wore these on flights from Boston to China and back and wear them when I mow the lawn.  Equally useful for either application."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought the QC15's back in 2011 and they continue to produce silky sound just like on day one from the package. That being said, I had to replace the ear cushions (OEMs are roughly thirty bucks). I dont consider this a bad thing or a fault on Bose since the oils from your skin and sweat provide an acidic environment that will degrade these over time and i would much prefer the comfort of these over some other option that does not seal as nicely around your ears.If you want yours to last keep them in the case when not in use, roll the cord, and keep them off the floor.... Dogs love stepping on these, my 53 pound vizsla ran over them at full speed when my wife came home from work once and the momentum shot them a few feet in the air, slamming them into a wall. They didnt break, but very well could of.The noise canceling will save your ears since you no longer have to listen to music, movies, or tv shows at more than 1/3 to half volume to drown out the environment. These are a must for airline travel, especially the horrible experience in traveling internationally. Bring an extra AAA battery for that and yes, rechargeable lithiums work great."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Privacy on airplanes and a far superior noise reduction system make these headphones my new favorites.Despite being a bulky package for carry-ons. I find this works well on airline sound systems as well as with my i-Pad.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I decided to try them for the 30 days.  1 flight I was hooked.  Noise pollution greaty diminished.  Changeable battery is the way to go, seems to last a long time."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have made several trips from Dallas to Dubai and these made the trip much better.  15 hours in a plane...painful.  They work much better than others tested or tried.  Not the best for HF listening normal use, but on a plane...#1."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Using these while running on a treadmill and the difference is amazing. I don't have too turn the volume up so loud anymore. The noise canceling technology is really amazing. I've also used them for traveling by airplane. Even if you're not listening to music, you can still turn on the noise canceling feature and quiet things down a good bit. I don't fly without these anymore!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My 3rd set of Bose Noise canceling.I have the QC3 (stays in my office) and QC2 (now relegated to the gym) - they both still work superbly.  Albeit, I have replaced the ear pads on them using 3rd party materials (see my other feedbacks for details), the replacement pads are not great - but good (4/5) enough for intended use.  I've had the QC15 for about a month now - using them sparingly and awaiting my overseas trip in a few weeks.  Having owned the QC2 & 3, the 15s are so much better - both, in sound quality and nose canceling (NC).  Side by side comparison QC2 vs QC15 - the QC15 NC system performs supremely better.  I'll spare you `geeky' details - and I'm not a `snooty' high fidelity guru - but I like good quality stuff.  I purchased these for $270 (Aug 2013) - If you are in the market for something less expensive but acceptable in sound quality and NC (my opinion - and personal recommendation) check-out the `Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B QuietPoint Active $140).  The AT's are not the same standard as Bose, albeit from a budget perspective.""Enjoy YOUR music... don't fret what others think""!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I keep forgetting to press button on headphone to turn the device OFF and so batteries are gone in 1-2 days... what a stupid design. Why cant they detect when it's put on the ear and turn batteries off by itself.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these headphones from Crutchfield instead of Amazon, only because they don't charge sales tax on orders to New York State. As for the headphones themselves, they do an incredible job at noise cancellation and are wonderful when used for listening to music. A lot of people have mentioned that they don't provide enough base, but to me they seem just fine. The noise cancellation is the main reason why I purchased them, as I like to sit outside on a balcony that's somewhat close to the road. They almost completely eliminate the noise of cars going by. The only comment that I can make regarding these that may be a concern, is that I suspect Bose will be introducing a newer version within the next 18 months. The latest version was introduced in 2009, with minor upgrades for use with Apple products in 2011. I called Bose to ask if they would be coming out with a newer model anytime soon, and as expected they declined to answer my question. Based on this model(with the exception of the 2011 upgrades) being 3-4 years old, I'm guessing that a newer one will be offered soon. As for now, these are the best noise cancellation headphones on the market."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am so VERY glad I bought these.  I really wanted to find some means to get some rest during plane travel where there's always loud talking people and screaming babies.  So I evaluated a number of noise cancelling headphones and I ended up buying these.I was given the ideal conditions to test these wonderful headphones.  I was on a 4.5 hour flight with people chatting very loudly, and the primary test was provided the very healthy baby sitting in the lap of the parent just behind my seat.  The inconsolable baby in the seat just behind me provided quite the stress test of noise against these headphones.  The unfortunate child provided consistent outbursts of screaming just behind my seat.  These headphones cut the overwhelming majority of that sound and I was able to rest (up until the point where the baby started kicking the back of my seat while on the parent's lap).IMPORTANT NOTE:  From my own experience, it seems no set of noise cancelling headphones absolutely blocks 100% of noise.  That is unrealistic.  However, these did a very fine job in cutting the sound to the point where it was trivial and made it easy for me to rest or at least relax.I did not have to blast the sound of my music in order to drown the obnoxious talkers around me or the screaming baby.  The headphones worked magnificently and I am glad for every dollar I paid for these.  I will never fly without these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I had the predecessor of this product and frankly although the build quality seems to have improved as-well as the weight of the product (feels less flimsy); The same could not be said in terms of audio quality which seems to have decreased. The noise cancellation abilities are better however and many background sounds that used to leak into the previous model no longer do so.*edit* Although I also own the Bose MIE2 Mobile headphones (for over a year now) which work with both Android and iPhone; the microphone that comes by default with the Quietcomfort 15 does not work with my Android even though it works with my laptop (which is not a macbook). This might be an issue with my phone (I will update once I look into it further).*edit* Bass is definitely worse than predecessorConclusion: Total disappointment from predecessor; This is by far the first product I have not enjoyed from Bose. Feels like a downgrade rather than an upgrade.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these for my mom who travels a lot.She seems to really enjoy the noise cancelling.I also had a chance to test them out and here is my opinion.(I also own a pair of Monster Beats Studio)Pros-Excellent Noise Cancellation-Less sound leakage than the Monster's (but there is some at the loudest volume)-Clean, crisp sound (Quality you would expect from a Bose)-Extremely comfortable and better build quality (compared to Monster Beats)-Design and Packaging is superbCons-I do like to listen to bass heavy music also, so the bass wasn't as deep and heavy as the Beats (which is expected)-Price (I know I also have the Beats, but I'm just saying $300 is a lot to drop on headphones)If you can afford it and need good noise canceling headphones, I would recommend them.Just an opinion from an everyday person."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Okay, for years I've wanted the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, but I kept buying cheap, and not so cheap knockoffs. I must have 4 sets of noise-cancelling headphones in a rubbermaid tote labelled &#34;headphones&#34;. Finally, before my last trip, I just went for it. What a difference! I wasted a lot of dough on the rubbermaid tote phones, but I've found my thrill at last. And the case they give you for storing the phones is awesome. 6 stars!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I used these QC15 headphones for the 1st time yesterday on a cross country flight.  How I ever got along without this device is beyond me!  It's the 1st time in my 47 years I was actually able to watch the in flight movie and enjoy it.  Phenominal sound with my iPhone, too.  It's like I was in my own private, little shell within coach seating.  Definitely worth the price!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am on my second set, just because I wanted to get a second set.  I have own these for awhile now.  Amazon didn't use to sell them, but I glad they do now.  My main. main, main reason I got these is because I tend to be a little rough on headphones (by accident) and I got tired of paying $30-40 and having shoddy headphones.  I am reviewing this not because of it's noise cancellation but it's ability to let you listen to crystal clear sound.  Love it.  I listen to my iPhone/iTouch with these.  And the sound is incredible.  You hear all the bass, trebles, horns, rich voices you really want to hear.  It makes the music very very personal as if you are in the world's best concert.  I also use them on my home theater and wow, it brings the base and distributes the sounds as if you are listening to it in surround sound.  I also used them on my computer and it sounds great also for gaming, tunes, etc.  Plus, there is a microphone accessory so if you get a call, you can speak to the other person and trust me, wearing these while using your iPhone, you will never mistake another word.And they are extremely durable.  Many times I have fallen asleep wearing these or I get a little entangle and the cord just pops right out of the headphones (designed to do that), so no more frayed or torn wires where you can only hear one side.  It is practically impossible to damage that cord from it getting caught on something.  The only tiniest drawback is that it runs on batteries (one single AAA), but that doesn't matter.  It is soooo worth it.  I normally get the Energizer Lithium/Ultimate batteries (silver color).  A little more expensive, but they last longer than just generic AAAs.  There is an on and off button on the side (the noise cancellation button), so you can always turn it off to save battery (when you aren't using it).  Also there is no noise leakage from these when you are wearing them, so you will not be disturbing your fellow citizens.Oh and I do wear these when I am flying (normally listening to music) and they shut off the entire world.  Makes it a more pleasant flight.I also want to say something about the noise reduction aspect of these headset.  It works.  It may not block out all the noise, but it blocks out a good portion of it.  I think they are better design than Dr. Dre the Beats (the other $300 headphones).  Listen, $300 dollars is a lot for headphones and I thought I would never ever be that person that would spend that type of money on something like this, but it is soooo worth it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"&#8220;Wide range of frequencies&#8221; is what&#8217;s written in Bose QuietComfort 15 documentation. Much of this high-tech headphone is proprietary, I don&#8217;t think even patented. But the price difference between a $30 noise canceling headphone and this one has a lot to do with this &#8220;wide range&#8221;. The former could be canceling a single frequency, and still call it &#8220;noise canceling&#8221;&#8212;legally. But you can simply hear the difference. I think the QC15 goes beyond calculating the inverse of a frequency to zero noise. It actually listens to the music you&#8217;re listening to and doesn&#8217;t cancel the frequency that is part of the music. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t detect any reduction in quality of the music while all the noise has been silenced. That&#8217;s also a lot of computation processing very fast. I tested this thing right next to a loud air conditioner and I still heard the loud silence the moment I turned on the headphone. It&#8217;s remarkable and almost magical because I don&#8217;t fully understand the technology behind it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I also wanted to try out some noise cancelling headphone so I headed to my local store and tested out these BOSE and a pair of BEATS. They both sounded good but I felt that the BOSE was a little clearer and the build quality was better. I decided to order them on Amazon because they got the best price. ^_^ I got the headphones today and decided that I must write a review for a product this good.I put the headphones and turn the noise cancelling button on and honestly I wasn't impressed. I thought I wasn't gonna hear the background noise with the noise cancelling on and the audio jack disconnected. It seemed like everything was filtered and all I could hear was my TV playing. Anyways, I just added this because I wasn't impressed at first.Later at night, I turned the headphones and plugged it into my ipod. I have to say that it I was very impressed with the audio quality. The sound was incredibly clear. I loved the vocal quality when listening to new Bon Iver CD. I wasn't expecting the headphones to have a lot of base because there Acoustic headphones but the base is damn good. I have to say that the headphones can bump when your listing to rap music. I mostly listen to Alternative, Rock, Rap, and Reggae and these headphones sound perfect on every genre that I tried it out.The only negative thing I can find is that my ears will sweat so I usually take the headphones for a little after an hour or two of listening to music. Other than that. These headphones are solid build and the sound is crisp and clear. Owning these headphones makes me want to re-listen to my whole music library again."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am so happy with my new headphones by Bose! They have very good noise canceling when you just have on that option, but WOW do they do a great job at noise canceling when you're listening to music or TV shows! They've been a real God sent for me because of my sometimes noisy upstairs neighbors. But now when they're walking around a lot, running their dishwasher, or running their washing machine, I can totally block them out when I am trying to watch my TV shows. I should have gotten these headphones a long time ago. And I just had to replace the battery, but that was a great experience too. The power light was blinking for a day or two, and I just kept using them. And when the battery finally died, the sound cut in and out, and then there was no more sound, so I knew that I had used up all of the battery power, and it was a good feeling knowing I pushed the battery as far as it could go. It would be nice if Bose could make a wireless option, in this day and age where more and more things are going wireless."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It's fine.  I used it for my international 14 hour trip.  It was comfortable, but I felt it didn't cancel as much noise that I like.  I'm not an audiophile whatsoever so I couldn't tell the big difference in sound between these headphones and another pair that I use at home.  Would I buy these again?  Prob not unless they go down in price.  I should have tried out other noise-cancelling headphones, but felt these were #1 due to reviews and I needed something immediately for my trip.  I suggest people try out different types of headphones before plopping down $300."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,honestly cannot live without them and wouldn't change them for anything great and comfy and everything is so clear to hear
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is Mr. Skeptical here... I almost over-thought this item because to me it seemed a little pricey, I am retired and on a fixed income. These Headphones do everything that you had hoped for them to do. Big time noise reduction and a great headphone. You can use them for noise reduction only if that is what you want, but they make my MP3 player sound great. Definitely a quality product.  Your turn to ""step up""..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these specifically for the noise-cancelling feature for air travel, despite some negative reviews about long-term wear.Although they worked well off-plane, on flights I found them invaluable. I now count them among my ""necessities"" for air travel.  I don't have any way to compare them with other noise-cancelling phones, nor have I had these for more than a month, but let me say that I watched several movies on a 12 hour flight and never removed them. The audio on the movies came through crystal clear.  Between movies I napped in relative ""silence"".  I saw two other ""commuters"" on a long flight wearing the same phones without a wire.  You don't need external audio input to enjoy the benefit of noise-cancelling.It is only when you remove them that you realize just how terribly noisy it is on an airplane. I don't know if there is a connection, but since I have used the headphones I have not experienced my usual headaches. In any event, noise- cancelling headphones are miraculous, and Bose has to be among the best.  It is ALMOST like sitting in a quiet room, very peaceful, and well worth the investment."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"+Very Comfortable+Noise cancellation a great feature+Comes with nice carrying case&#62;Uses AAA Battery not rechargeable, you can put a rechargeable eneloops and works but I would not trust any other brands just in case they leak acid.-Expensive-Only work on iphone ipod does not work on any android. The mic and volume buttons are useless-Does not work without power, so its on with sound isolation and your music or no sound at all-Battery compartment very snug, every time I change the battery it feels like I can accidently snap off the lid-Does not block all sounds, only repetitive / white noise sounds."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have been traveling a lot for the past 2 years and its literally been that long that I have been agonizing over this purchase.  If you are reading reviews you are probably in the same boat I was. $300 for head phones??  Its a tough one for sure.  Let me put it this way, even if you travel once a year its worth it.  Most trips I have taken I want to strangle someone, not sure why people are such retards when traveling, but I am just trying to get from point A to Point B.  The more you travel the more it gets amplified.  I could see where someone that can use these at work would be very happy with these too.  Bottom line is I wish I had bought these 2 years ago.I bought some cheaper noise canceling headphones from Sony (MDR-NC7) and I have some decent in ear headphones from Sony also.  The in ear block out as much noise as the noise canceling ones so the noise canceling ones from Sony where a waste of money.  Not only do they not perform the noise canceling function very well they also sound very weak.  Now keep in mind that I am comparing $40 headphones with $300 ones.  I never expected the $40 ones to do as good as the Bose but seriously, if you just get some cheap in ear head phones you would be just as well off.Noise Cancelation:The test at Best Buy with specific noise (Jet noise simulated) at the Bose display is astounding to say the least.  I agree with several other reviews that the Bose head phones seem to pick particularly easy frequencies to block and it is most certainly aimed at lower range.  I first tried these while watching a rather loud movie and I felt that gave me a much better representation of what to expect in an airport or airplane while traveling.  Most noise was blocked and the voices where lowered a great deal, with music at medium levels most of the noise was blocked out.  From what I read on the Bose website there is a Mic on the outside AND the inside of each cup.  You can read up on the specifics, I can tell you that it does a very good job.Sound Quality:I saw several complaints in reviews about the sound and all I can say is its Bose.  I have a Bose stereo in my car and immediately had to replace the speakers.  I totally expected the same mediocre sound quality with the headphones.  Decent sound that is brought to you from the cheapest drivers they could get away with.  Profit driven?  You bet.  Unfortunately with headphones there is not a darn thing you can do about it.  Personally I am happy with the sound but know I should be getting a ""Little more"" for my $300.  Because of the noise canceling you don't have to cut the volume up as high as you would without to hear details as clearly.  For me the overall sound is very good but its no Dr. Dre's either.Construction Quality: ****Update below \/ \/ \/ *****I have not had these long enough to know about defects or short comings.  I appreciate the fact that the head phones come with a decent case and I think the overall feel is ok.  I have seen a few people ram these into the seat back while on a plane and a back pack before, I suppose these are the people complaining about the head phones falling apart.....imagine that.  I understand how someone paying $300 for head phones and having it break right away could be frustrated but take that with a grain of salt.Package includes:Head Phones (Can be used without a wire for just noise cancelation)Semi-hard Shell caseWire for regular mini plug connection wth High/Low settings for Airplane adapter useWire for Iphone/Ipod/Itouch use (Has same features as OEM Apple ear phones, i.e. volume up, down, pause buttons and built in mic)2 prong to 1 Airplane Adapter1XAAA Battery (MAKE SURE YOU PACK A SPARE AAA) you can not use the headphones to listen to music with out a batteryWarranty bookInstructions in many languagesUPDATE ######  07-05-2012  I have had these headphones long enough to add additional comments on the construction quality.  I strongly urge people to use the semi-hard shell case to carry your headphones.  I took one trip that I had very limited room to carry my case so I left it in my luggage.  I will never do that again.  I see clearly now how people break these while traveling.  Its not practical to wear these the entire trip especially when its 100 degrees outside and parked in a plane for an hour on the ground, this exact situation happened to me so I put them as gently as I could in the seat pocket but I almost broke them taking them out.  Just bring the case and deal with it.  Keep in mind you are buying cutting edge technology headphones that sounds decent and cancel a majority of outside noise....not indestructible headphones.  They are not butterfly wing fragile but I could not see a single failure point either that would have me overly concerned.Since my purchase Dr. Dre has come out with noise canceling headphones for about the same price.  Personally I would buy those instead after listening to them but all in all I am still happy with my purchase.  By far the best money I ever spent for traveling.  My last trip there was a totally annoying child screaming his lungs out and all I could do is put my headphones on before take off and cut them on (I could care less when the flight attendant said)  I played music at the highest clear volume and was smiling away as I looked around and saw one after another passenger's face filled with disgust and aggravation.  The trick is to point the LED AWAY from the flight attendant side and just tell them it is off and they will leave you alone.  To be clear, the highest undistorted volume on this headset is probably 60-70% of the Dr Dre's.  Good thing is it can drown out pretty much anything.  Another good thing is you did not have to have it at unsafe levels for total sound blockage."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Having used these headphones for three months i feel it is enough time to leave a competent review. I bought these headphones because everyone raved about the sound, comfort, and noise cancellation.SOUND: I want to start by saying i am a regular guy that likes music and radio. I am not a professional, an audio engineer or anything of that sort. Do these headphones sound good? Yes. Do they sound noticeable better than a cheap set of ear buds? Yes. Is it something that will blow you away and change the way you listen to music? Not really. In other words, these sound good and they are fun to listen to, but the way some people make it sound you would think it is astronomically better. They are not. There is one thing i have to say about these headphones, they are not good to listen with cell phones. I have tried them with a Samsung Galaxy S3, an LG G2 and an LG Optimus F3. The volume is not as loud as it should be. I like my music loud and these guys don't deliver in that aspect when you are using these with a cell phone. I hooked them up to my desktop and the sound is much louder and richer. It could be that the audio card on the desktop computer is better.NOISE CANCELLATION: One of the biggest plus in these headphones. The noise cancellation is awesome. It is amazing how much sound these guys block out. For the past six months i had construction making terrible noise outside my house. When I put these guys on i can't hear anything. Sounds like lawn mowers, drills, car engines and microwaves go away without any problems. It doesn't block everything though. For example, voices are only blocked marginally. Once you put the music at least half way you will not be able to hear anything. On more than one occasion i have missed delivery packages because of these. You are in your own world when you put these on with volume over 50%.PACKAGING: These headphones come in a pretty nice case that offers very decent protection. They fold flat on the case which makes it very convenient if you want to take it on the road in a backpack. Along with the carrying case comes two audio cables. They are fairly skinny cables that are considerably longer than your regular Apple ear buds. I really hate how the cable gets tangled very often with chairs or other objects when i am walking around the house using the cell phone.  One of the cables comes with volume control but it doesn't work with Android phones. The middle button pauses/continues the songs though. If you triple press it quickly it skips to the next song. I am surprised that the cable has held up so well considering i keep pulling and tangling it every day.CONSTRUCTION: I seen a lot of people bashing the construction of these headphones. The headphones are not made of indestructible metal, they are made of plastic. That is not to say that it is bad though. I have accidentally dropped the headphones from my hands to the floor in more than one occasion. The headphones are still intact. I also like that the headphone band is very flexible. A lot of time i like to only listen with one ear and place the other cup a little behind my ear. Like i said, it is flexible so it doesn't break or anything. The band on the middle is made of leather which makes it feel premium. Personally, i like it a lot. The only thing that has me worried about these headphones is the little door that opens up so you can insert the battery. It is also made out of plastic and i am afraid the plastic might get fatigued after a couple of years of use. The actual door that i am talking about is like the ones in TV remote controls that have the little snap sound once you close it. If it ever stops snapping correctly i fear it can stop the sound completely since the headphones do not work without the batteries. The construction could be improved but it is not nearly as awful as some other people make it out to be. If you treat them carefully they are going to last.COMFORT:  The plastic construction makes the headphones very light on the head. I have tried other headphones that weight considerably more and it just becomes painful to use after more than an hour. I bought the Beats by Dre Studios and i returned them after a couple of days because how heavy they felt. The size of the cups were small too. I had days where i used the QC15 for more than 4 hours in a row without feeling any discomfort. Actually, i will go ahead and say it, these are the most comfortable set of headphones i used in my life. If you want to use headphones for extended use, these are it. The cup size are pretty big and they fit my ears perfectly.BATTERY LIFE: I use a set of 1.2V rechargeable batteries to power these headphones. I use it an average of 3-4 hours a day. Each battery last me an average of 1 week. The right cup shows a blinking light that warns you a few hours in advance when the battery is running out. If you are planning to use the headphones a lot consider purchasing a set of rechargeable batteries. You will go through about 4 batteries a month. I don't think the 35 hour estimate made by Bose is accurate. I feel it is closer to 20-25 hours. But then again i have only tried them with rechargeable batteries.In conclusion, i like these headphones a lot. The only reason why i don't give them 5 stars is because they are very expensive ($300) and because they require the use of batteries. It would have been great if they could be used without batteries even if the noise cancellation didn't work. The sound is a considerable improvement over regular ear buds. The comfort and noise cancellation are the best i ever seen in a set of headphones. I have no problem recommending these headphones if you can stomach the high price though."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are my second pair of Bose I've owned. I had the QC2 before this pair, and I can tell you, BOSE ARE THE WAY TO GO! The quality of music, every tap of a drum, ever breath the artist takes, is so crisp and sharp. You don't have to blare your music anymore to hear how good it is. The noise cancelling is great at cutting out chatter for people and particularly good at removing the rumbling noises from jet engines while flying and the road and engine noise while in a car or bus.Really though, I cannot recommend Bose headphones enough! I love them more than my 5.1 surround sound from my computer. In all seriousness, if you're willing to put down $300 on headphones, you'd be a fool to get anything other than these. There are some very small companies that have better systems, without the noise cancelling, but for more than twice the price, not to mention, if they break, that's on you. With Bose, I have had only one issue over the past 6 or so years of owning a product from them, and I can tell you that their customer support is phenomenal. Immediate replacement of my headphones, no cost to me. No questions asked.If you are willing to spend $250 - $450 on a pair of headphones, there is no better option in that price range than these QC15's. They are truly a remarkable piece of technology and I cannot stress enough just how great both the build and sound quality are."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Words cannot describe how great these headphones are.  They were a lifesaver on the plane and I some of the best money spent.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had the luxury of experiencing the Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones on a recent international flight. Noise cancellation is impressive; the sound of the aircraft virtually disappeared even without music playing. I ordered a pair of these headphones the day I returned from my trip.My point of comparison is my set of Shure sound isolating earbuds (current model SE315). For years I was impressed with their ability to block outside noise while allowing me to enjoy a movie or music. The Bose headset takes noise cancellation to a whole new level.The tradeoff is ""bulk"". I always carry two sets of Shure earbuds in my travel case so I and my wife can watch movies during flights. Carrying two full-sized headphones is less convenient plus I suspect the headphones are more prone to damage.Whenever space allows, I'll carry the Bose headphones and enjoy their superior noise cancellation. When packing light, I'll carry the Shure earbuds."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are arguably some of the best headphones in the world.  Bose invented noise cancellation, so obviously this is top notch.  Audio quality is superb, as expected from Bose, clean clear sound top to bottom, no over accentuated bass and/or treble frequencies, that's not the way to really listen to music, Bose has it right, unlike some other popular brands. Finally exceptionally light weight, comfortable and durable.  As long as Bose keeps doing what they're doing (or gets better), I'll never own headphones from anyone else.  If you want to test them, find a Bose store.  Buy these, you won't regret it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchase other headphones (Beats, Sony, Soul) but quickly realized that I should have listened to what all the reviewers said about the Bose.  Just because the others are similar in price doesn't mean they are all the same.There are several variables in my decision.  1). The size of the case is much better when fitting into a laptop bag. The cases for the Soul and Beats were huge and not very flat.  The Bose is flatter by far.  2). Sound bleed was very bad on the Soul and the Beats and Sony.  If I sat next to someone while wearing these, they would not be happy because they could hear the sound too.  Not good for others. It seems the Bose are better about preventing sound leaks around the ear cups.  3). Comfort.  The Bose felt lighter on my head for extended periods of time although the others were not uncomfortable.  4).  Sound was more than fine for my needs on the Bose when listening to podcasts, audio books and music.  I suppose you might argue that the Beats or Soul are a tad better for music, but that might be true only for certain types of music.  Noise canceling function works extremely well on the Bose and imam writing this after having used them for several overseas flights.  5). Price.  Not as much a concern for me since the others i tried were similar  in price.Try them.  You'll keep and enjoy them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I decided to invest in a pair of these or similar to cut out the noise around cubicles at work when I want to focus on something. I am easily distracted. A friend of mine had a Dr. Dre Beats headset which is the same price, so it was between this and the Beats.Here's my observations and basis for a 4 star review:- Background noise cancellation: works perfectly - they seem to have perfected the art of cancelling out the background hiss of ambient noise or white noise, if you can call it that.- Used them on an aircraft, and they were great at cutting out the engine roar- I've tried the Dr. Dre's as well and the Bose QC15 is superior in this area.- As far as the fit and comfort go - i'm neutral, as I've not tried on too many other headphones like this- Why this review is 4 stars and NOT 5 stars: As far as the noise cancellation goes, they do not do a good job of cutting out voices or any other noise outside background hiss. This part of noise cancellation seems to be missing. Overall, the sound of people talking is far reduced when the headset is turned on, but without playing music, you can still hear people talking in the background, even if they aren't very loud."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Summary: mediocre microphone, comfortable for all-day wear, suggest rechargeable batteries for daily use.I use these in the office mostly and for occasional travel. The noise cancellation is really great while traveling, but get a headset with a more directional mic if you plan on using it for phone / Skype calls. Unfortunately the mic hangs facing away from your mouth, picking up other people and room noise. My office is not extraordinarily loud, but in order to use this as a headset, I must hold the mic directly in front of my mouth with one hand and have the other hand ready with the mouse to mute/unmute the mic.I recommend rechargeable AAA batteries. I go through about 1-2 every weeks, depending on how much I use them for music. The 35-hour estimated battery life seems accurate."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have to admit the 17 1/2 months I've used these headphones (almost daily) they have been stellar - perfect noise blocking on trips, helpful for concentration on sticky work projects; great sound quality on all types of music - absolutely no complaints...until (insert 1950's horror discovery noise here) the left earphone started fading in and out and then finally gave up the ghost a day later.  Replacing batteries, praying to the audio gods didn't work - they were dead and the warranty had expired (only 12 months).  Online searches for people with a similar problem found little help from BOSE - evidently they are solid state and cannot be ""fixed"".  Should I contact them and see?  In this day, it's rare to see or hear of companies standing unwaveringly behind their products - can you prove me wrong, BOSE?"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are rated pretty high, but not from anyone who has owned a pair of them for a significant period of time. So let me fill you in on some serious quality issues I have seen after owning a pair for about 6 years (in the order the events occured). Mind you I have always babied these things and kept them in the hard case, so thats why I find this particulary disturbing (well, that, and the fact that they cost $300).1. About 3 years ago, as I was adjusting the headband, I noticed that the plastic had broken where the two pieces slide into one another. It was bad enough that crazy glue was not an option. So I contacted Bose fully expecting to be able to get them repaired or replaced for a reasonable fee. No such luck. The Bose rep told me I could purchase another pair, period. He may have offered a discount, but it must not have been a very good discount because I recall ripping him a new one for such bad support. I was going to throw them away, but I took one more look at the damage and decided the try to fix the broken area with some tightly wound electrical tape. This worked well enough, so I kept them, determined to get a few more months out of them.2. About a year ago I noticed that the on/off switch was intermittant. You have to push extra hard to the right to get the red light to come on. Wierd, but I can live with that.3. This past weekend I placed the headphone earpieces down on my dads fine wood clothing bureau and when I picked them up a few hours later I noticed that some of the soft cushion had stuck to the wood! It appears that the cushion is deteriorating!! There were little black cushion bits everywhere. There was nothing on the wood surface to cause this, except possibly for some very light wood polish.Now, these things would be forgivable if this was a cheap pair of headphones, but this is BOSE for gosh sakes, and these cost $300! Whats up with that? You buy a brand like Bose precisely becuase you assume the quality after 6 years will be excellent, not just fair or good.So, yes, the sound quality is very good. And I am sure they have made some design changes in the past 6 years. But the overall quality of the pair that I have is  most certainly NOT good. Have they addressed all of these issues in the current model? I have no idea. The BOSE rep did not tell me about if they did. But based on my experience I am very dissapointed in BOSE and will never again waste my hard earned money on a pair of thier headphones again. There are plenty of other noise cancelling headphones out there that are just as good, for alot less $$. My advice is shop around and consider this review before you fork over big bucks for these headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I listen to classical and high fidelity orchestrated music. When I'm feeling really good I listen to trance, ambient techno, and so forth - the QC15 neve, EVER disappoint. Although I have I have wanted more BASS it is not the fault of the phones but the hardware. These phones will expose the quality of your hardware very fast. Be careful not to blame them for the hissing and so forth as it is almost always the hardware the BOSE QC are connected to.I see so many young people with these DR Dre phones on and I have used them - you have no idea the amount of BASS and treble the BOSE can produce that will destroy the Dre's (yes at a +$100 difference) if the hardware allowed you to up it. Hands down the quality and FIDELITY are off the charts. Always have a single spare AAA on hand bont dont stress out - the battery lasts about 3-4 weeks and that's using the QC 15's daily (for a total of about 40 hours non stop).The only complaint I have is that for $300 the QC 15's come with a fairly cheap cable. I got a year off mine, including traveling on a weekly basis before it started coming apart. They needed to have a braided cable like the monster cables do or something (the cable does not allow for poor audio quality so dont worry).  other than that the phones are a MUST HAVE.I highly recommend them to anyone who flys alot."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I finally broke down and bought the Bose headphones.  They are definitely much more comfortable than my $140 Sony MDR-NC200D Digital Noise-Canceling Headphones, which makes my ears hurt after a half hour or so.  Bose also does a way better job at cancelling out the jet engine noise than the Sony.  The headphones come with a flat hard plastic case and the ear pieces twist flat to fit in the case.  Initially, I thought the case would be too bulky for my backpack, but the flat design does make it easier to pack and protects the headphone.  I guess I should mention that the sound quality is really good."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I can't say enough positive things about these headphones. They are so comfortable and put you in a bubble of silence. I wear them at work, no music playing, just to block out coworkers. Highly recommend. I've wanted them for years and they totally live up to their hype!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The noise cancellation was incredible, and the sound quality was very good.  But $300 for a pair of wired headphones is too much.  The stock picture is misleading because it doesn't show a wire.  Bose should have built in wireless capability to these headphones as an option.  I tried using them around the office and the wire was always in the way.  I took them back.I also noticed:- No battery, no music- No auto shut-off, so don't forget to flip the switch or your battery will run dead- An obnoxious clicking sound when the battery runs dead"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have owned these wonderful Bose headphones for a couple of years now and use them several hours a day. They are still going strong.  Here are some pro's and con's:THE GOOD- The sound spoils me. Really. It is hard to tolerate listening to music with any other lesser speakers (not just headphones).  Indeed, with these, One hears nuances in my music that I did not notice before. The way I would describe the music is CRISP, deap and spacious.- Noise canceling is excellent. I am disabled after suffering brain trauma and  cannot tolerate much noise nor commotion around my home - yet I have three small kids!  These Bose save the day; all-day and everyday. I can block out most of the noise with the noise canceling just turned on without music. When the rest of the noise needs to disappear, I simply play some light music from my iPad. The world magically becomes completly silent. love them!- They are extremely light and comfortable. I can wear them for hours a day with very little fatigue. These are the only over the ear headphones which I have owned that do not rub my ears and cause irritation.- I love that e cord easily detaches from the headphones so that I can take advantage of the noise canceling without chords.THE BAD- They do create a practically airtight seal which causes a weird air preassure change that you feel. Wearing them with the noise canceling turned on thus has an effect on your ears as though you were swimming a few fear under water. I have gotten use to it but it took me a few days. Everyone whom I have had tried he headphones, notices this air preassure change. Yet, they tolerate it because they are blown away by the noise canceling and the quality of sound.- The only other con is that they do cause my ears to heat up and slightly sweat. I find that I need to take the headphones off every 30 minutes or so, just to give my ears a breather for a few seconds.In short, these bose QC 15's come highly recommended. If your purchase them, I can pretty much gaurentee that you will enjoy them and feel that they are well worth the money."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I've had a pair for about 10 years. These are the best NC headphones overear! I brought a second pair just to have the blue. Purchased the QC20i and I don't think they comparing well.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I tested these at Bose but the price they wanted was much higher than what I paid. The noise cancelling is so good. I put them on while off then turned it on and the 1st time about 60% less noise. Now after about 3 weeks it more like 90% of the noise is now gone and seems to keep getting better. Also it has no problems with the highs or lows sound. it is so clear and comfortable to wear. I will buy the cordless to see if it just as good in a few years.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I recently broke my old Sony's so I decided to try these to despite the stupidly high price. I have to say the headphones are amazing and I can't find any complaint at all. Except the price.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have a pair of sony mdr-nc500d noise cancelling headphones that I thought were pretty good. But after I tried on a pair of these, the difference is astounding! The Bose headphones filter out way more background noise and sound is amazing! While they are more expensive than a lot of others, they are definitely worth the price."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Best noise canceling headphones I've seen.  With music going, ambient and other noises just fade away.  A must have for traveling, or just to really enjoy music."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel quite a bit, a few times around the world every year. The next best thing to business class is wearing a pair of these in economy. It makes a huge difference. Whether paired with my Zune, the onboard entertainment or just with them on with no cable attached while I am sleeping. I've had them a little over two years and I wouldn't hesitate to spend $300 to replace them. The bluetooth units are nice but you just can't beat the simplicity and universal availability of AAA batteries. And it lasts a long time on one AAA.Maybe Bose could come up with a bluetooth dongle that fits in the cord port on the head phones. It would be great to have a choice but probably too much battery drain.As far as the durability/cheapness issues go. It reminds me of reading the reviews for the Samsung S3 mobile phone, people complaining about the durability of the phone because it broke when they dropped it on a concrete floor. Umm, yeah, whatever. I got my Bose headphones while I was deployed in Afghanistan, used them every single day for over a year and they still looks the same as the first day I took it out of the package. I often fell asleep while wearing them. I am surprised the cord hasn't given out yet but when it does it's only $20 to replace it.Fits me well and I have no problem wearing them nonstop on a 12-14 hour flight.Do I wish they cost less than $300, sure. I also wished it didn't cost $90 for a second checked bag in economy too."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The sound quality coming from this headphone is exactly the same as bose ae2. The noise canceling is fantastic. You don't even have to listen to any music, once you turn it on, you will stop hearing most of noise.However, I really cannot wear this phone for more than half hour. I feel ear pressure immediately, like I'm taking a high speed elevator, my ears get sweating, and hot. The pressure sends a biological response to my stomach and thus feel a little sick. I love the sound and function. But obviously, this is not for me.The other downside about this earphone: it is tied to a AAA battery. It cannot function without using the battery."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have traveled with these several times now and they are wonderful.  I think they are the perfect addition to my iPad.  pop in a movie and I am outta here.  The sound is so rich and clear, and sometimes I sit right near the engines on the plane (hey, its steerage).  In my opinion, worth the price and Bose stands behind their product.  I did have a slight hum in one ear, so I called to find out if it was normal, it is not.  They asked me to send it back, they paid shipping, and they sent me brand new ones!!  Find a company like that nowadays = Bose."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Awesomesauce! These are very comfortable and really do work for steady noise. Please note that they will not cancel intermittent noise such as someone speaking! However, I got these for long airplane flights and they really work well. I was on a 9 hour flight recently and the engine/air noise was loud enought to be uncomfortable until I put on these headphones. Bliss! I even left them on and powered up without any music or videos just for the noise reduction. I did find a bit of &#34;ear fatigue&#34; after about 5-6 hours (since they work by actually directing sound against the outside sound). I took them off for about an hour to rest my ears, then back on they went. I have a couple of long trips coming up, and am recommending these to anybody who asks!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I avoided Bose earphones for years because of their high price, instead settling for Audio Tech. The Audio Techs finally gave me feedback troubles, so I bought a new pair, and they exhibited the same problem right out of the box. So I returned them and bought Bose instead. They have been fine. I think the noise canceling is a bit better as well (or perhaps it's the earphone fit), but the great advantage has been the lack of howling that afflicted the earlier earphones whenever I moved into certain positions. (I wear them at the gym to mask the awful music piped into that place, so this might not be as much of a problem for the road warrior trying only to silence the jet engines.) Anyhow, the Bose earphones were well worth the additional cost."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am very picky about sound, have a high end stereo at home. The sound of the QC15 is outstanding, you can easily separate sound components, the bases are deep enough to be real-like and rounded without sharp surroundings, not the tap-tap sound of cheap sound systems. I haven't tried it on a plane but at home it nicely muffled completely my noisy heating system, grand kids screaming in the house, the old fashion flashing toilet, oh well you get the idea. If in doubt, give it a try, the return policies are excellent.I didn't give a 5 star simply because I don't know what perfect is."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've had a couple pairs of Bose noise cancelling headphones and these are my favorites. The QC3s are more compact (and therefore have a slimmer case, which I like a lot), but they are &#34;on-ear&#34; instead of &#34;over-ear&#34;. The &#34;on-ear&#34; set-up gives me a headache if I use them for too long. Since I originally purchased these to help me study in the school library, that was a problem.The QC15s are over-ear, and I can wear them for a 5 hour stint with no issues. They block out most low level noise, but if there is a sharp noise, you will still hear it. Thus, these are fantastic for blocking the noise from an airplane engine humming, but not so great if you wanted to mute the sound of your kid's drum set. The case for the QC15s is pretty thick - almost inconveniently so. However, overall these are great headphones and I recommend them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My brother has recommended these for years and I finally decided to pick up a pair. All I can say is Wow! These are amazing noise cancellation headphones. They are extremely comfortable and the 'no wire' option is a huge plus.I have to admit, I haven't used these while flying yet. I have used them in my cube-land office setting and I have found that they help me concentrate and minimize distractions. (If you work in cube-land, you know what I'm talking about. My office environment isn't noisy, but it isn't quiet either. People taking on the phone, the annoying guy that has a radio in his cube turned up just enough that you can hear it but can't tell the song, impromptu meetings held in hallways, loud talkers, etc.)So what do you get for $300? The headphones, carrying case, battery, aircraft headphone adapter, two different wire options for listening to music - one with a combination in-line volume control/microphone for cell phones, one just for listening.I have to admit the $300 price tag was an issue for me. However, I am an audiophile and have loved Bose speaker systems since I purchased my first stereo system. The speakers on these headphones do not disappoint. For those who are new to Bose, they are a bit heavy on the bass. If you're looking for music headphones, I would suggest trying on and listening several different pairs - this is a totally subjective area. What I like and what you like may be totally different. However, if you are looking for a set of noise cancelling headphones, these are fantastic. The bonus is that you get a Bose sound system in addition to noise cancellation.For the record, I've used in-ear type earbuds for years that were billed as 'noise reducing' or 'sound isolating.' You know the type - they fit in your ear and physically block out the sound. The problem is that after a few hours, my ears would be sore. I certainly liked the small form factor (easy to lug around), but was always a bit disappointed by their performance with music and with noise cancellation. In addition, ear buds are notorious for breaking.In addition to the great sound (or lack thereof), they are very comfortable. I've worn them most of the day and I haven't had any complaints. I have a rather large melon and they fit me very well. From speaking to others who own a pair, they seem to fit almost any shaped head well. They are also comfortable in 'DJ' mode (when you have one cup off your ear to hear what is going on around you). These headphones have a solid feel, yet flexible. I've owned other over the ear headphones (Sennheiser, Denon) and these compare very well to them as far as build quality.Finally, the nicest surprise was the quality of the carrying case. These store flat (the ear cups rotate) and the case does not take up a lot of space. There is also room for any extras you may want to carry - it can comfortably carry the aircraft adapter & cords in the included mesh zipper bag. There is also room for an extra battery or two, a small USB charger, etc. You won't be able to pack a lot in the case, but it is sized well. The case makes it easy when packing - I carry a laptop and the case slides right in. Packing for a trip would be no different.The only con I can think is having to carry around an extra 'AA' battery or two, but this is minor compared to how well they work. The plus side is finding a battery won't ever be a problem - almost every airport gift-shop carries double A's.Overall a great set of noise cancelling headphones. Highly recommended."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Great headphones... I love the noise cancellation.  I am wearing them right now and can't even hear my typing!  Some people are complaining about the bass is to heavy for rap...  Isn't that a good thing? Also try on a pair of beats!  SO MUCH more bass with beats.  I like them.But a little pricey.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Seriously, Bose, the cord looks awfully flimsy for a $300 item. And it turns out, it actually IS that flimsy. With light use, and no cordwrapping of any kind, the thing started cutting out within six months. Now it's unusable, the internal wire apparently cracked or severed (looks fine on the outside). I'll look into my warranty options, but I Am Not Pleased. Won't by Bose again."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought to replace the previous model. Frankly, Bose has done a great job of finding a jet's audio frequency and drowns it out very well but I was hoping the new model would do a better job with other noise like kisds and babies. Disappointing there."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,You just cannot beat them. A little pricey but well worth it. Great sound and or use for noise reduction.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"We could write a huge review full of our perspective and technical facts, however, everyone else who likes or dislikes Bose has done that already.  We purchased two pairs for our college aged kids and they love them.  I have a pair that I've used for years for business travel, and enjoy them every time I'm in the airport or tin can they call a plane.....especially with young kids or babies around me!!!Amazon has the best price, quality, delivery, so what else can you ask for right?  Lot's of choices out there, so if you have the time or you're into the latest style these might not be for you....however, stay with the proven leader.....go with Bose!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"While noise cancellation and comfort are great, the sound is not really all that &#34;wow&#34; and and it feels very cheaply made. Not to mention the cord, very skinny with no strain relief at the jack (kind of like a skullcandy jack). Therefore it was returned."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Picked up a pair on a whim before a 40 hour total flying-time round-trip from the US to India.  Was skeptical at the price but knew Bose has a reputation for quality.  I have flown over 400,000 miles in my lifetime and can't believe I never thought of buying some NC headphones.  They come well packaged in a nice carrying case that will protect from all but the most extreme conditions.  One word describes these: AMAZING!They reduced cabin noise over 90% even when not listening to music.Made the inflight entertainment system tolerable and I could actually hear the dialog without loosing my hearingLong battery life.  Single AAA battery lasted entire tripComfortable enough to wear for hours on endHave volume and mute control for Apple devices when using the additionally included cordNot much more to say but I am totally impressed with these and am glad that I picked them up."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These work really well.  I don't understand the technology, but they are actually noise canceling The first time I used them was on a commercial flight.  We know how noisey they can be.  They out performed the noise canceling Bose earbuds.  Worth every penny!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"A few years ago flying on a cross country trip I was fortunate enough to be bumped to first class.  I sat next to a rich dude who subtly bragged about his material possessions and owned property during take off and landing.  One of the items he bragged about was his new Bose headphones, and he insisted I listen to them.  Sure enough, they were outstanding, but I didn't travel often enough to justify the price tag.Well fast forward a few years and I now have a job that requires me to fly a few times a month.  So I took the plunge and used my hotel loyalty points to get me a free set of these Bose headphones.They impressed me out of the box as much as the very first time I listened to them (or the equivalent I had tried a few years back).  The noise just melts away into the background so that it is hardly noticeable at all.  I took my first flight with them today and tried them in a very busy crowded airport terminal.  My music sounded wonderful, and the cacophony of random people and machine noise all but vanished.  And that was quite a challenging test, the noise levels were pretty high in a fairly confined round terminal hub.  The music source was simply my phone, a Samsung Infuse, not a dedicated music player.Next I wore them on a plane for a short 80 minute jet flight.  It's like being in a different world.  The music from my android phone sounded awesome, the noise practically vanished.  Somehow without the constant racket of the plane the time seemed to just go by quicker too.The headphones were extremely comfortable, and the excessively hot day didn't add any problems either.To me Bose are a company I have a lot of respect for.  They always seem to innovate and amaze.  As an audiologist I am well versed in acoustics and the physics of sound, and to create this level of noise reduction so seamlessly is very impressive, especially if their claims of battery life are close to accurate.The headphones fit in a very attractive slim case.  There is even a little space in there for a couple of spare batteries if you wanted.  This model ships with a standard headphone cord and also an iPod/iPad/iPhone version which has a microphone on the wire.  I question how useful that would be simply because when you wear these headphones it is hard to tell how loud your own voice is to some extent, so I'd be worried about shouting to the person on the other end of the phone, and also if it is noisy enough to wear them, I wonder how well the person being called would hear anyway.  In any case, I replaced my iPhone with an Android based phone recently so I've not tested that feature.The bottom line is these are expensive headphones.  Truth be told if you go to Best Buy and listen to some other headphones at half the price, you'd probably get better or similar sound quality.  What you won't get though is the incredible noise reduction system that Bose has been working on for many years.  That combination of a great sound AND the noise reduction is what makes this product work.  If your life involves plenty of air travel, or other similar travel that includes background noise, then these will really improve that journey for you.  Music sounds great, audio books are far easier to hear, even Angry Birds is more enjoyable without all that background noise.  In fact when you put these on in almost any environment, it makes you realize how much ambient noise there is in so many places.I think the only real issue is if your budget and lifestyle justifies the price tag.***Update: Since writing this I have also tried watching a DVD on my laptop in my hotel room.  Again these headphones eat through noise like the air conditioning, ventilation in the bathroom, noises from other guests, the whir of the DVD drive, the refrigerator etc.  The sound quality off my laptop was just exceptional too, rich bass, clear treble, good mid tones.  I can already see myself using these for more than just plane rides."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I use noise cancelling on planes and during travel at various hotels. The Sony and Audiotechnica have a white noise buzz which does not work for getting to sleep, but the Bose were quiet and when used with foamy ear plugs got a great night of rest.  Zzzzzz for Bose for both the plane and hotel room."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I debated for awhile about the Beats Studio by Dr. Dre and the Bose.  The one thing that put me over the edge is the noise cancelling quality and the remote iPhone/iPod control for volume and functions.  I'm very glad I did, as I couldn't be happier with the Bose purchase.  As for quality for a $300 headphone, it's hard to tell right now, as it is plastic, but the sounds quality is superb!High recommended!!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"We had two pair of the earlier generation of these. Each pair developed a problem after 3-4 years of use. A little fiddling, a quick bit of soldering and we combined them to get one working pair from the old ones.  My 11 year old son just used the old pair on a cross country flight and we got two new pair for ourselves.The new ones appear to have slightly more room in the ear cup and worked great our flights."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have to admit I have only just received this pair of headphones, but I have been wearing them regularly for the whole day. This review will be updated accordingly as I discover new flaws or new methods to overcome existing ones.First of all, the noise cancellation is top-notch. I have tried out a pair of Beats Studio in BestBuy and I don't really like it, plus I think the design is a bit too bold and ""in your face"" for me. As others have pointed out, the Studio's noise cancellation isn't exactly good, so when I ordered this pair of Bose online (I didn't have the chance to try them on in BestBuy because there were a lot of people on Black Friday) and got them, I was pleasantly surprised with the NC, I can't even hear my own heartbeat!I am not an audiophile but streaming music 320kbps on Spotify premium sounds really crisp and sharp, with the small details popping out like the sound of a harp, perhaps.At the time of writing, the one extremely major flaw is that the headphone bleeds sound. When listening to music on my iPhone with the volume anywhere above level 3 (three small white boxes), which is extremely soft, my girlfriend who is sitting beside me can hear what I am listening to. I bought this pair of headphones expecting to use it in the library when some people there think it's funny to talk about games and girls while people are studying for midterms, but now it seems that this is no longer possible if the headphones continue to bleed. If anyone manages to overcome this issue please leave a comment and let me know.Next, I don't know why but the headphones tend to slide off my head when I'm lying on an incline 45 degree chair, and the side of my ears get a bit itchy after wearing it, so I might be doing something wrong here because people are saying how comfortable this pair of headphones are.In short:Like:- sound quality- noise cancellation capabilityDislike:- bleeds sound (MAJOR FLAW)- slightly uncomfortable for meUPDATE #1:After talking to a Bose Facebook operator, I checked my fit and indeed I was wearing it with the top band a bit lower than it should be (right on top of your head). After adjusting the fit, the sound doesn't bleed as much now but it still does (at around 40% iPhone volume now as compared to 20-30%). One thing to note is that I kept my inline control at LOW, meaning the volume isn't as loud, so 40% iPhone volume at LOW is quite soft for me. I will try this product for a few more days and update accordingly."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Like many other users, I have experienced the same ""pressure"" when using them without input of any kind. With music on, this feeling is almost imperceptible. With time, I've noticed it even less, so I concluded it must be a perceived and not actual pressure. Once you get over it, you'll enjoy these headphones for what they were meant to do: quiet time. Great fit and comfort, good sound reproduction, very light and portable. A bit on the plasticky side so I hope they last.  Yes they are expensive but I haven't found anything this effective to compare against."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I looked at an number of other options for NC headphones and ended up going with the Bose.  The noise cancelling is incredible and they are very comfortable.  I don't know a person that owns these and is disappointed in the performance.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I use the Bose headset to kill the noise on long airline flights.  It does an unbelievably good job of producing the recorded sound and blocking the extraneous noise.  Worked so well I tried it in the dentist's office but found the noise there is generated internally and can't be blocked.  The set is comfortable for wearing hours' on end and seldom requires battery replacement.  Expensive, but worth the price if you have a need for noise cancellation."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have tried the $80 Panasonic noise cancelling head phones, and this Bose QC15 set.  The Bose are the clear winner in terms of ""cancelling"" ambient noise.  Don't get me wrong, these or any set of noise cancelling headphones won't cancel all ambient noise, but for trips from the USA to Europe in economy class (meaning the back of the jet) they are a great help.  I would not dream of traveling without them.  As to music reproduction, well, my fifty-something ears are happy to have some relief from the jet noise and to be able to hear my music or ipad movie soundtrack.  I also use these headphones for long auto trips, wherein the wife likes to sleep and I can listen to my iphone/ipod downloads.  Much more comfortable than ear buds and, again, the ambient noise is managed very nicely.As to comfort on the head, they are fine.As to build quality, they seem fine.  Lots of plastic but nothing has broken so far.  The single AAA battery goes for a very long time.  I do not like the semi-proprietary cable that Bose supplies for the connection of the headphones to the output device.  A plain 3.5mm stereo plug will work but one has to work at it due to the Bose weirdly designed inset socket in the headphones. Bose could have made this a non-issue, but they didn't. I mention this because I have a cat that likes to chew cables, and at some point I will need to replace the supplied cable.I am grateful that Bose and others have come up with a way for traveling or working in a noisy environment to be more comfortable.  Well done Bose.  Mostly."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Some of my friends have already bought these headphones for themselves after I raved about them. I fly almost weekly and grew weary of crying babies and sinus-snorting neighbors. These fit comfortably and block most of the noise. They fold neatly into the carrying case which has enough room for my Ipod and reading glasses.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bose QuietComfort 15I have resisted buying Bose for a long time. I have tons of other headphones that are uncomfortable and urt my head and ears. I have a drawer full of headphones with shorts in the fixed wired cable and ones that simply sound bad. I have at least one other noise canceling set that literally do not cancel out any noise. If I add up what I spent for all those bad headphones, I could have had these a long time ago (maybe two). I am not an audiophile, but I enjoy my music. I have over 2,000 songs on my iPad, but I listen to more music on Pandora.I do my most listening to audio on my iPhone with the Stitcher Radio app. Podcasts satisfy my listening pleasures as well offer a convenient way to stay informed of my interests.  I also enjoy watching movies and TV episodes on my mobile devices. The Bose QuietComfort 15 is wonderful addition to my world. They sound beautiful and so comfortable I hardy know I am wearing them. I am tender headed and most headphone hurt the top of my head (especially more that it covered less with hair these days).My family is decorating the Christmas tree as I type this and I can't hear any of the constant chatter except barely between songs. It is funny to see their lips moving, but I hear no sound  With a wife and two preteens girls, I finally have a escape that doesn't remove me from the room. I love these and can't wait to use them on my daily commute on the bus next week to and from work.Pros: Comfort, Noise canceling is fantastic, case quality and shape, soundCons: Pricey, Battery is required to function at all"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these to replace a pair that I had owned for 8 years, which the wife broke trying to put them in the case bending the cups the wrong way.  I called Bose to see if I could replace the broken yoke, but unfortunately, it was not a repairable item.  Bose, however, offered to replace the broken set with a new, latest model for 1/3 the retail price.  I jumped at the chance and then bought this set for my wife so she could have her own set to break.  Working with Bose service was very easy:  answered call immediately with no wait;  service rep. spoke clear english (bit of boston accent...lol); and the RMA and replacement process was very convenient and fast.In terms of how this product works, well I travel to Asia several times a year and would not leave on a plane trip without these.  It filters out nearly all the Plane engine noise and with a little soft music it pretty much filters out all background noise.  Battery life is excellent.  I am not a audio geek so I really can't speak to the sound quality, other than it sounds great to me.Yes, you pay a little extra for Bose, but you also get what you paid for.  Note, this product is made in Mexico."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These will forever change the way you fly. Engine noise, crying babies, annoying talkative (but friendly) passengers, etc. all gone. It's like you're in your own world. When you take them off after a 2 hour flight, you realize immediately how great these headphones are.A few things to note:-Carry extra batteries with you. The headphones will not work without batteries. You have to turn them on for any sound to come out. Battery life is excellent. You'll be able to use the same batteries for multiple flights, but you just don't want to be stuck without.-It can be difficult to sleep with these on. It's not very comfy to put your head against something, and if you do, you could get unwanted noise and vibrations. With just the right positioning, it is possible though, or if you can sleep without your head having to be to the side.-Noise cancellation essentially recognizes the repeating pattern of a sound. So something like jet noise is easy to cancel out because it's the same sound over and over. Sounds like talking are not easily cancelled. However, those types of sounds are greatly reduced from the noise isolation of the over-the-ear  style headphones, and the sound of your own music usually drowns those other noises out.-The volume does not need to be up all the way. I don't like blaring my headphones, so I usually have the volume at about half on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3). And that's plenty to get the full appreciation of the headphones.-The sound quality is good. Decent highs and mid-range tones. If you prefer heavy bass, it may not have enough, but the main reason you should be buying these headphones is for the noise cancellation."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've put Bose noise cancelling headphones on in the store a few times and was never that impressed at how they didn't cancel out background voices that well.  Which is what I want when I'm flying.  I don't know if the design got better or my use change.  In any case, I've been using them while mowing the yard and I'm very happy with them.  Yes, that is a terrible way to use a very expensive set of headphones.  But having good sounding tunes makes mowing much more enjoyable for me.  Paired with an iPod, mowing has become a relaxing time for me.  In the past, I used sound isolating in-ear buds covered by over-the-ear hearing protection muffs.  The ear buds I had (Denon) were very good, but they died and I had not been able to find a good substitute that adequately isolated noise from my ears while still sounding good.  The Bose headphones sound good, are lightweight and comfortable, and so far I haven't replaced the batteries this season.  I've experienced no ringing in my ears.  I do make sure I limit how loud I'm playing the music.  I am curious to see how well they work the next time I fly somewhere."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have just about every genre covered on my ipod touch. My primary genre is Classical, but I explore different genres as well. Hip-hop (in different languages) R&B ( in different languages), pop, rock, foreign music.. etc. So, anyhow, I was able to test the headphones with my device at my local target store. There was NO difference from my current BOSE headphones and that is even with the noise cancellation feature.. I could get the headphones for a fraction of a price through a friend, but it is not even worth 300.00..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Go ahead, spend the extra money and get the best...BOSE!  As a bona fide music snob, I can recommend these for the beautiful clarity of sound.  I also find the noise cancelling more than sufficient.  As we all know, there will probably never be headphones that completely cancel out sound, but this is about the best you can get!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Literally the best electronics purchase I have ever made. Super expensive and super worth it. Knowing what I know now after experiencing them on a daily basis I would pay double. Battery life is excellent. Throw these on at work while going into the zone and everything I mean everything fades away. You can hear a thing but what you intend to hear which is the music. They also help for crying babies at night when you can unplug and just turn on the noise canceling feature. Now the noise canceling alone isn't going to stop gunshots, be realistic. They help with ambient aggravating sounds. I always use a fan and night and sometimes reading a book in bed can get irritating. Put these on next to the fan and the fan noise literally goes away! Super awesome. People at work love them. Love the quick detachable audio cable. Can't tell you how many times I've caught the cable on something, rolled over it in my chain or one of my kids yanks it out. Headphones never leave your head and they don't get damaged. I always thought of bose as over rated. I stand corrected. We tested these at work with someone else's beats by dre. Same song same audio level. You couldn't tell mine were on standing around me. You could sing along to his. They do not leak noise."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I needed a pair of very high quality noise canceling headphones that I could use alone - in a situation where I can't connect my iPod. After doing some research, most everyone suggests that Bose are the best. In addition, I know several people who also own these and recommended them when I told them what I was looking for. Without hesitation, each strongly suggested that I get the Bose, even though they are extremely expensive. After some thought, I took the plunge and bought them - I just received them today. Needless to say, I'm absolutely amazed - I wore them in several public places and all noise (with the exception of voices and a siren) completely disappeared. While sitting in an office, the music being piped in to the waiting room disappeared. I'm sitting at home now, wearing them, and all sounds are gone - including the noise my computer makes and the air conditioning. I'm THRILLED!Update: After I wrote this review, I received another expensive noise cancelling headset,SOUL by Ludacris SL300WB High Definition Noise Canceling Headphones (Black/White). I have now spent a lot of time with both and think that Bose is superior. I wrote a rather extensive review on the Soul if you want to see how they compare."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've had to use these headphones a lot lately to watch movies without disturbing my family.  They're very comfortable for two hour movies and the battery lasts a long time compared to a cheap JVC noise-cancelling set that I used to have.  I never thought I would pay $300 for headphones, but these are definitely worth it.  The noise-cancelling works well so you protect your hearing because you don't have to turn on the volume that high to hear what's going on.  I love these so much that I recommended them to a coworker and he also purchased them and loved them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I was shocked at how pleasant a flight could be with these headphones.  I didn't really think they were providing that much value until I took them off a few times to see what the noise really was.  They are  much more effective with an audio input running (mp3 off my phone) than without but my wife asked how my flight was and I told her it was the most pleasant flight I've ever been on (she doesn't yet know I spent $300 on a pair of headphones).  I later thought about that comment...  it really was the best flight I've ever been on because I was totally relaxed and actually enjoyed my music and reading.  VERY glad I got these so far.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I was initially blown away by these headphones when trying them out in an Apple store.  Amazing sound from an iPod and the QC15s almost entirely blocked out the din of noise in the store.  Bought a pair and after several days use...they're going back.Bottom line:The QC15s are plastic and have a cheap appearance.  They are doing remarkable things with plastic these days, so plastic does not equate to flimsy or breakable.  It's the appearance.Sound quality is really good.  But for the price, would be nice to have great.Noise cancellation is superb.  This is the strong suit.  Frequent flyers love them for that.  I,however, do not fly frequently.  I need noise cancellation for the neighbors' leaf blowers and baying hounds.  Think I will go with ""the poor man's"" (or, since I'm in Tennessee, the redneck's) noise cancellation headphones--ear buds and shooter's ear muffs.These are pricey...unless you are a frequent flyer who needs this level of noise cancellation, I would look at other options."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I do feel that these are overpriced, but the noise cancellation is excellent and helps me to better listen to music or the audio track of a movie I'm watching while I'm sitting on an airplane without having to strain my ears.  The headband and earphones sit very comfortably over my head covering both of my ears. I'm not an audiophile, but I find that the audio it plays does sound fairly clear to me.  The aesthetic design appears sleek although the build quality does not feel particularly sturdy. It does come with a nice travel case and the audio cable is conveniently disconnectable.  The headphones only needs 1 AAA battery to turn the noise cancellation on, but if you don't have a working battery in there than it ceases to adequately function as a set of headphones (technically it does still play audio into the earphones, but at a severely reduced volume that is difficult to hear anything), which is my main knock on these headphones, along with the inflated price.Overall, the comfort and the high quality of the noise cancellation ability move me toward recommending these headphones if you travel frequently on mass-transportation vehicles (airplanes, buses, trains, subways, etc.), and can afford the high pricing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Finally got the opportunity today to test these in flight.  I was sitting right on the front end of the wing, next to the engines.  These phones are incredible and I'm very sorry I didn't shell out the $$$ and buy them years ago.  They make the arduous task of flying a real pleasure."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I was going to return these because they are just so insanely expensive. I've been putting them on to the test around my house (which is hell loud) from the traffic outside. Trucks and cars bang and slam into pot holes while they go by all day and night, it's constant. I bought these with little hope of alleviating the problem. My jaw was literally on the floor when I put these on and stood at the window watching the cars slam by and heard nothing! I wore them outside and you can still hear the traffic but at a much lower decibel level. I wanted to hate these so I could get my money back and yes, they wreak like cigarettes (must be the packing material) but the noise cancellation is beyond my dreams. I have left the music on the lowest sound and been able to relax. My mind and body! I'm not all tense and wound up since I can't hear the traffic. It's a whole different world with these on. While I'm going to struggle paying them off, I definitely feel like these are a necessity if you live in a loud house or apartment. They drown out street noise and bassy-type noises. I love them! UPDATE- after a few days of using them, they pick up sounds I didn't even know were there watching tv; I keep taking them off to see if it's an ""outside"" noise. These headphones are outstanding! Plus they have already paid for themselves in noise related anxiety reduction alone. I wish I hadn't waited so long to get these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"i can say that i sent them back because i was looking for more bass for $300 dollars, so these might be for someone but not me.  but if you  do want bass, look at the Skullcandy Crushers."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Please be aware that you can't listen even *without* the noise cancelling if your battery dies.The battery that came with them (I know, I should have used a fresh one) died twenty minutes into a three hour flight.Not cool.Also, it's such a *small* battery.Would be so much better if they looked into solar powering these things...Wish I had returned these even though they work great *with* the battery because I have enough to remember in my everyday life without having to worry about a battery for my headphones, but alas, I missed my window."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It has been a personal dream of mine since I was a young lad to get a pair of these at some point in my life, and this past Christmas that dream came to fruition. I couldn't help but think, ""Is this real? This is!"" As I unboxed the package and looked at all the glorious contents -- the sleek case, the soft around-ear cushions, the Bose logo in silver -- I couldn't help but get a slight feeling of skepticism. Now that I had what I've wanted for years, now that it is in my hands, will the product perform to my built expectations??Romantic and slightly-exaggerated verbiage aside, I can tell you after using the headphones consistently for weeks in a variety of settings they indeed perform. It's amazing how much easier it is to read on a plane with a pair of these on. Even when in my quiet room at night beside my lovely wife, playing music softly as I wind down for slumber is on a different level now. The noise-cancellation works impeccably.I think what surprises me the most is the crispness in sound. With a lot of composers and DJs I've listened to on these, I heard subtleties and intricacies in songs I had never picked up on, even on songs I've listened to an absurd amount of times. Bands sound so crisp it's similar to being at a live show. If you're into dubstep, don't expect to be blasted with bass -- instead be prepared to hear bass at such a sharp and rich level you'll be able to feel the modulations in frequency (Production will show, too; you'll quickly figure out which DJs are new to the scene). Unless you are used to Bose headphones or a related brand/price level, your music experience will be much different after putting these on your ears.In my job I travel 1-2x a month, so these work extremely well in that situation. However, I love using them at home during the week, too. I've even been tempted to bring them into the office for those down times of each day.I've seen some reviewers talk about how the make is cheap compared to competitors. I've been a Bose enthusiast for years, and if there's one thing I know it's that they don't make their stuff cheaply. I own several Bose products, and I can tell you each of them still sounds new after 5+ years. Even if a Bose product does take a wrong turn, if you take it to them directly they'll stand by their product and make sure you're treated right. But in terms of breaking easily or being made cheaply, I would hope no one would treat a $300 pair of headphones carelessly.These headphones are an investment just like any other high-end product. But if you love listening to music, have an occupation where you regularly travel, or you haven't had the chance to truly experience a Bose product, this investment is worth your time. If you are seriously considering these, I'd recommend going to Best Buy or a Bose store at the mall to test them out as there are a couple different models of their headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Even a little surreal, the first time you activate them.  These things are like an upgrade from coach to business, at least in the sound and stress departments.  By that standard they are a bargain.The sound is good, too.  Better, in my opinion, than my other set of headphones which, with their dedicated external amplifier, cost close to three times what these did.  Those will be up for sale.They do not work at all without activating the noise cancellation.  The sound is there, but faint.  This makes me suspect that these use the battery to amplify the sound signal as well as to drive the noise cancellation feature.  Add decent little speakers and you end up in a category of headphone performance that is unusual at this price.They blow away many headphones at this price point by  using the same principles that audiophile systems use:  good headphones (probably equivalent to 70 to 100 dollar models) with a dedicated, battery powered signal amplifier (300+ by itself, generally).  Then they go a step further and blot out all the outside noise (non-existent in the audiophile world).  The cherry on top of the icing is that it's all built into the headphones.  No mare carrying around a bag of wires and boxes for good headphone sound.  The resulting silence allows inner details to come through and convincing dynamics.There are many better sounding headphones out there, though for this price it will be hard to find some.  Those will also need help from headphone amplifiers and require a quiet environment.  They will not work well in, for example, an airplane.  They will not sound good with an iPod without an outboard amp.These do create a sense of pressure inside the ear cups.  This can get old after about an hour.  You'll want to take them off to let your ears breath.  That said, most headphones create some degree of ear fatigue, anyway.These headphones contradict many stereotypes about Bose being overpriced, sub-audiophile items.  The price is reasonable for what they deliver and they sound very good!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I tried on several of these headphones in the stores. They were the most comfortable I had ever worn.  Sound is great and noise cancelling is excellent but after wearing for 20-30 minutes they start to hurt my ears.  I do have big ears and they stick out from my head so I guess it is partially my fault.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Sound quality is better, and I like the fact that the ever so easy earphone cushions of the original can be replaced with new ones without having to repurchase the new Q15 if your budget can't handle it or you simply are still happy with your original Q15s. The originals the cushioning while comfortable was not durable. A sneaky way for an up sell. I am glad to know that if the ear pieces need replaced, I can do so for about $40 plus s&h. I have the new Q 3s as well. They are comfortable, but feel the new and even the original Q15's have better sound quality and the noise cancelation while does its job, the design of the ear piece can easily make it less noise canceling. Choosing between the models I would definitely recommend the new Q15 over the Q3."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"After trying on about fifty different headphones, I finally bought these at the Bose store in Leesburg, VA.  After using them for a week, I am extremely happy with them.  The sound quality is awesome.  In fact, I listen to more music than I ever did before.  The noise cancellation is excellent, but that's not the reason I bought these.  These are the most comfortable headphones I could find anywhere.  All the other full size headphones are much heavier and feel tight on my head after an hour.  Last night, I wore these for two hours straight without a problem.Initially, the noise cancellation bothered my.  I felt pressure on my ears.  But they sound so good, I didn't want to return them.  I have gotten used to them now.  The bass comes out loud and clear.  The mids and highs are clear and crisp.  I have tried these with my smartphone, computer and even the roku 3 remote.  All music sounds excellent.  These sound much better than the Sony MDR-V55 headphones I got for about $80.These are expensive.  I got mine for $240.  But, they are worth the money.  Especially since Bose really supports their products and will not give you any grief if anything goes wrong."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is a great ANC headset.  Its very light and truly performs and totally dampens the noise in the A/C cabin where I used it.  Did not try at home, however, in aircraft, you will hardly even notice that the engine is on and the aircraft is flying.  Would not recommend it for pilots as you would not notice if your engine is running or not!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Look, this thing is amazing if you're a frequent flyer. I haven't tried other models but after using this on a few flights I wouldn't bother with any other model. But when using this outside a plane, it's not worth the price. Keeping in mind that this is battery powered so it won't work at all without batteries. Second, the sound quality is good, but I didn't appreciate it that much. I'm not a Beats by Dre fan (meaning I don't need all the bass) but this thing just isn't loud enough when you're not using it inside an airplane. It's like the magic only happens when you pit it against an airplanes engines."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I own less expensive noise-reduciing headphones. These are the real deal. Their test run was travel involving around 15 hrs combined flight time (10-12 hrs for the trans-Atlanitc legs) each way. I used ear plugs to sleep, but otherwise had these on all the way.Pros: comfortable, don't feel any weight. Nice case, holds my ipod nano and plug adspters easily. Good build quality. Good battery life. Excellent noise cancellation. Excellnt sound quality.Cons: pricey (as with anything Bose), cannot use them with power offOverall, I love them. Money well spent if you travel, or want to tune out the world from time to time."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Bought it as a gift and is going strong for more than an year. Very good noise cancellation and great sound. Very good for traveling and comfortable for long use.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've tried a lot of ANR (active noise reduction) and normal headphones.  By far the best has been the ANR's and Bose.  Bose may not have invented ANR, but they seriously have taken in to the next level.  I have taken my QC-15's around the world several times, in everything from planes (suggested) to helicopters (not suggested) and I absolutely must say they are the best.  I do have to say that if you get these, and need to fly in a helicopter, do not use them (you will blow out a speaker or two).The ANR works wonderfully, but even better, the range of sound from the head phones is absolutely amazing.  I love my QC-15's, and when I burn these out (I use them 23 hours a day), I will gladly spend the money to get new ones.  My greatest suggestion that I can give, is keep your receipt, BOSE has a great return policy, but not if you don't have your receipt.  Seriously, if you like music and your ears, BUY THESE."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Received the Beats executive headphones as a gift, and I could not stand them, as they were quite heavy, and ear crushing, and it made you want to take them off after 15 minutes.  They were that bad!  Oh yeah, they were great for bass sound overkill creating a hip/hop Phil Spector bass wall of sound, but fidelity wise, the clarity to hear those many crucial instruments, was not there.  I took them back to the store, and exchanged them for the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 noise cancelling model, and what a difference.  The comfort of the Bose was immediately noticeable, as I can wear these for hours if needed, without that heavy ear crushing feeling.  The noise cancellation on the Bose was also noted to be superior.  Yes the beats construction is obviously more solid, with more metal, and extra weight, but that is precisely why they are not very comfortable.  The ear cups of the Bose is soft leather, and it contours around your ear much better than the hardened lining of the Beats.  Also, on the beats, there is a hiss that is annoying when the noise cancellation is activated.  They both will not work when the Noise cancellation is not activated.  Overall, for superior comfort, and better noise cancellation, as well as a higher quality of fidelity, the Bose is my choice.  If it is a louder thumping bass sound you crave, and more solid metal parts, then maybe the Beats are for you.  I tried them both, and  the Bose QC15's, make for a better overall listening experience."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've been looking for noise canceling headphones for a while now and after much research and hemming and hawing, I purchased these from the Apple Store in Grand Central Station in New York. After less than a week of owning them, I returned them. My overall thoughts:* Noise cancellation - 10/10 - First, people have to understand what you can expect from noise canceling headphones and what you can't. ""Noise canceling"" is probably a misnomer. The whole industry should probably call them ""White Noise Canceling"" headphones. Noise canceling headphones will NOT get rid of all noise. It gets rid of the hums, buzzes, vibrations...the noise that you forget is there but is there. These headphones do a great job of getting rid of those sounds. It also does an adequate job of limiting voices around you, but that's probably just due to the fact that these are over the ear phones and not because of the noise canceling. If you want headphones that will simply reduce the overall decible level, you're probably going to want to look into what Etymotic has or Direct Sound EX29, which as the name implies supposedly can drop the decibel level by 29.* Durability/Quality - Don't know, but I would bet against it. - Sorry, I walked into a Best Buy and their display model had the leather of one of the ears completely off. That simply didn't sit well with me. And their warranty is only for a year and you have to pay for shipping both ways. Sorry, if you pay $300 for a set of phones, the LEAST they can do is warranty the thing for two years and pay for shipping if there are any problems. I mean, after all, the assumption is that if you're charging your customer $300 they're getting a superior product in every way and they shouldn't have to worry about poor quality, right? If you're going to give me the same warranty that I can get for a pair of $25 phones, then what am I paying for?Let's put it like this. My friend has a pair of AudioTechnica's and I don't feel the Bose give you anything more in terms of quality.* Sound - I thought the sound quality overall was good but it wasn't like I was blown away. I felt that nothing was accentuated. If you're looking for super base, these are not the headphones for you. The good thing is that you can set the volume at 50% or lower and hear everything great because of the noise canceling. But the sound quality itself didn't make me feel that I got my money's worth.* Sound leakage - At 50% volume, you *can* hear sound coming out of the headphones, but nothing that would disturb anyone in a quiet room. It's nothing to worry yourself about. If you have the volume at 100%, well you have bigger issues, like your ears being assaulted!* Comfort - 0/10 and ultimately why I returned them - YMMV and you may want to take my opinion with a grain of salt here, but no matter how I adjusted these things, I felt uncomfortable downward pressure on the top of my head. Let's put it like this. I returned them around 7:15pm EST today and right now my laptop says it's 11:15. Four hours later AND I STILL FEEL PRESSURE ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD! When I mentioned this to my brother-in-law, who also has a pair, he said, ""Oh, you have to tilt them forward a little more."" So he obviously has noticed it as well. Bottom line, however, there's simply no position I could find that made wearing these headphones comfortable. By the way, although the padding seems buttery soft, once the padding is compressed you can feel the hardness of the headband QUICKLY! The hardness of the headband was what I was feeling, no matter how much I tried to loosen them. I actually don't get that, because I wouldn't expect that."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are great!  They have excellent sound no matter what I plug them into.  Noise cancelling is nice to as I can put them on to read or study and drown out the TV or appliances running.  My only complaint would be that since I wear them so much they sometimes get uncomfortable but I think it's the combination of the ear cups and my glasses.  If I am just listening to music and have my glasses off it doesn't bother me so much.It's also nice that these come with two cords, one Apple product rigged with a volume control and mute right on the cord and one not.  I do seem to go through a fair amount of batteries so I keep some spares in the very nice case.If you use headphones a lot and appreciate the quality of Bose sound these headphones are a wonderful product.I selected these when picking between these and Dr. Dre beats...a tough decision as both have fabulous sound."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"People who are saying that these block ambient noise well, have significant hearing loss.I am far from a youngster, and have my share of hearing loss... (...worked in military and civilian aviation, shot more than my share of guns, etc.) Right now, I am at a well-known fast food restaurant (the clown's place), with this headset on, with a brand new battery.I can hear slightly muffled nasty background music. The news is  blaring from the flat screen on the. It's at about 1/4 full volume, and I can hear it, even though I can't make out all the words. The kids in the next booth, behind a partition - I hear them, as well as a guy few tables away talking to a kid who works here.QuietComfort? Hardly! Maybe if you wear them in solitary confinement!Pros: The pads and the head band are comfortable.The sound is great.The case is nice, but overkill.Cons: Battery doesn't last long. I use Duracell ProCells.No auto-off. Is it really that hard to make the thing sense that there is no audio, and auto power off after 15 min or so?!  300$ and the Bose sticker ain't enough to warrant that simple feature, which every 50$ cell phone has?!If you think this is going to cancel out jet engine noise on flights, as some here say, you better get some hearing loss to go with this headset! It can't even block out elevator music and conversation in a half-empty restaurant!So tired of paying so much for so little besides fluff, advertising and brand..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I notice the noise canceling the most when I'm on an airplane. It's not as good for blocking out people talking, babies screaming, etc., but for steady noises (like plane engines), it's fantastic."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I received these as an office party favor. For free, I like them. I don't think I'd spend the money on them for myself.Positives:Noise cancellation is freakishly good with white and pink noise. These silence my dishwasher. They quiet, but do not silence, my clicky keyboard and my Mac's mail received noise.Bose did a good job by including two types of audio cable (regular and with iPhone style controls) and a nice carrying case. The headphones can be used for sound isolation without having an audio cable plugged in. One of my friends pointed out immediately that this would be a useful feature for anybody with a sensory deprivation fetish. Not sure about that one myself, but it's probably a valid point in the positive column if you like that sort of thing.Neutral:Sound quality isn't on the level of other headphones in this price class. It's good, better than most of the headphones people use, but not amazing.I never bought into the noise canceling headphone concept before because they always felt odd to my ears. Not the physical shape of the things, but it's sort of a feeling of pressure caused by a residual very soft, very high pitched audio. This is partly due to my sensitivity in that range. If you are also somebody who, when TVs were CRTs, could tell that one was turned on in another room of the same house because the tube emits a high pitched background noise you can hear, you will probably notice this effect. These headphones exhibit that effect, but a lot less so than other models I've tried.Negative:Build quality feels too cheap for the pricing. The plastic, the battery cover that feels flimsy and needs to be pushed to lock in. Not impressed.They can't be used as regular, non-noise-canceling headphones. If you turn off the noise canceling switch you lose audio as well, except for a very faint sound. These must rely on an internal powered amp."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Pros:- Amazing noise canceling, best i have tested so far- great ergonomics- works and is comfortable over glasses (i'm wearing glasses and it was important for the headphones not only to isolate noise, but to be comfortable as well)- great a headset functionality working with Mac and iPhoneCons (only one i've found so far):- don't when noise canceling is off"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These things are awesome!  I fly often enough that I wanted a nice pair of noise cancelling headphones.  These work very well, and these were a refurbished pair.  They came in and looked as if they were 100% new.  I have had them for about a year now with no issues or complaints.  It came with a nice hardshell case to prevent damage when tossing them into a bag or briefcase.  The battery life is excellent and I think I've only changed them 2x in the past year with considerable use!As a note - always keep a spare battery (AAA) on hand - if the battery dies you won't be able to use them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Paying 300 bucks for headphones isn't for the faint of heart or the average budget, but some things are just ""necessary"". First of all, I travel frequently (two or three times a month, at least), and noise cancelling headphones are ESSENTIAL for air travel. People don't seem to be as thoughtful as they used to be -- there's often someone blabbering loudly and incessantly on flights, as if they're oblivious to everyone else onboard. Or the person sitting next to me that thinks it's socially acceptable to spend an hour telling me their life story. Now...I'm no grouch, but there are limits.  Secondly, these Bose headphones have proven invaluable in my work, which often involves a lot of intense data analysis (I'm a computer security consultant).  With these headphones, I can disappear into a world of pleasant sound (I highly recommend Liquid Mind for studying or intense work!), and work far more efficiently and with a lot less stress.So...bravo! for the headphones, and a knockdown to four stars for the somewhat flimsy feel to them and the price. For $300 I'd expect something far sturdier, and the thin cord worries me a little.  No doubt Bose is making money hand over fist with these things, but hopefully it's not at the expense of quality.  Time will tell."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had a Sharper Image noise cancelling headphones but felt like it was still allowing too much noise.  I thought I would try these and wow, what a difference.  When these go on everything goes quiet, there is no hum, no background noise, nothing.  I was a little hesitant because of the cost, but now I am extremely happy.Also, these are a lot more comfortable.  After an hour wearing the Sharper Image my ears and head hurt.  With these I can keep them on 1 hour and feel nothing.I tried ordering from Amazon but they would not ship them to Hawaii, so I ordered them direct from Bose for the same price with free overnight shipping."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these headphones about 18 months ago. I used them most every day. I don't listen to music loudly and the headphones just sit on my desk when not in use. I think I take relatively good care of my things.Today, the left ear started making a hissing noise. If I wiggle the cable connector (the plug that inserts into the headphones' jack - not the computer/device end) the left ear starts to work for a few seconds and then goes back to making the hissing noise. The hissing noise is the same exact noise you hear when wearing them but noise cancelling is turned off (no sound from device and a muffled background noise). If I unplug the cable all together and turn noise cancelling on, only the right ear works. The left ear sounds like noise cancelling is turned off. This bit of self testing suggests the jack inside the headphones has a loose connector or the left speaker is blown/on its way out. This isn't something a new cable will resolve (which are relatively cheap and I wouldn't mind shelling out for). Bose apparently only warranties their products for a year now, so I am SOL.EDIT: After more playing with it, I have determined the issue is in fact a blown speaker. See below for a potential fix you can perform for less than a penny, but know it is only a temporary fix. You will need to re-position the fix quite often.For 300 dollars, these headphones really should have lasted a lot longer than they did. I'm rather upset. I had always been told Bose produced quality products that would last generations / not just months. That's why I ultimately chose these over the competitors.While they worked, I loved them. The sound was great, and working as a software engineer with loud fans all around me, the noise cancelling was heaven-sent. I talked them up to everyone, including my CEO. I guess I have to backpedal on all that now.EDIT: I found a fix on YouTube for the issue I had. I am not upgrading my rating as they shouldn't break in the first place, and this isn't a true fix, but more of a patch - it doesn't last forever and requires re-positioning on occasion. If you have the same problem, try searching YouTube for this: ""Repair your bose headphone with a piece of paper"" posted by ""Sebastian Gatica Moris"". Instructions are in Spanish, but easy enough to follow."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these about 2 years ago, or the version they were selling then.  The sound quality is good but not, in my opinion, good enough to justify the price or to equal other high-priced headphones.  More importantly, the earphone cushion material is coming apart.  I only use these headphones occasionally (travel and sometimes at home, though I prefer speakers).  The cushion material is flaking off badly and getting all over me and my clothes.  My daughter has a similar problem with her &#34;overear&#34; Bose headphones bought only 1.5 years ago."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I got my Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones just before leaving for Brazil, a 10-hour flight there and 11 hours back. I'm a long-time frequent flyer and I really should have gotten them long ago, but I kept balking at the $300 price tag. As it turned out, I had a fair amount of Amazon gift cards on my account, and used them for the purchase. Suffice it to say, I'll never go without them again.First, the comfort factor. On both flights, I had them on for nearly the entire duration, whether I was actually listening to music or a movie or just wanting a little quiet for sleep. The headphones never became uncomfortable.As for the audio quality, well, they're Bose so the sound is fantastic. Now for a word or two on noise cancellation. In my experience, noise cancellation is most effective in blocking constant, droning noises, such as the rushing background noise you hear during a flight. The QC15s perform in this area very well. But oddly enough, I could still hear PA announcements, and I heard them even better because the background noise wasn't there to drown them out. Likewise with the passenger seated next to me...I was able to carry on a conversation even with the headphones on. So if you're expecting to hear pure silence when wearing these you might be in for a surprise.The QC15s come with two separate cables, one just for audio, and one to use for both audio and telephone, if you have an Apple iPhone. The iPhone cable is great for audio in that it has an integrated volume up/down and reverse/forward switch. But using them for a phone call felt a bit odd to me. Maybe it's just something that takes getting used to.All in all, a great product, and probably even worth the $300."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am a private pilot and own a Bose X aviation headset. It is an excellent product and worth the $1,000 I paid for it 7 years ago. It has excellent noise-cancellation capabilities and is so comfortable that I frequently forget I'm wearing it.It was with this background that I purchased their QuietComfort 15 headset. I work in a noisy 'cubicle farm' environment where there is a constant background noise from scores of development PCs and their cooling fans. Think Dilbert without the laughs.  I was hoping that the QC 15 would give me some relief and I was not disappointed. When playing music or soothing environmental sounds the QC 15s literally take you to another world, dampening the annoying fan noises and giving me much needed peace.If that was the end of the story it would still be worth the $299 price tag, but it gets better. Just for laughs, I took the QC-15 up in my noisy single-engine airplane and did an 'A/B' comparison against my Bose X headset. I was totally blown away when I found that the QC 15 was almost as effective as the dedicated aviation model in masking all the low-frequency propeller noise.  This got me to thinking that it was a pity some smart company hadn't created a 3rd party device that added a microphone to the QC-15, thus creating a discount aviation headset. Some research (Google is my friend) revealed that a smart company *had* done just this. For a very reasonable price they sell a boom mike that plugs into the standard QC-15s jack.So now I have a great headset for work and home use as well as a second aviation headset for when I take passengers up for rides. Talk about your win-win situation and ultimate bang-for-the-buck. This is a great product."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I usually listen to music at my computer in my den.  Unfortunately, the wall next to my desk is shared with the laundry room.  When the washer or dryer are running, the hum of those machines always intrudes on the music I'm listening to.I had Bose QC2s which served me well for years, but finally died.  I couldn't bring myself to spend the $300 for a pair of QC15s, so I tried Grado SR80i headphones... good sound, comfortable, durable, but didn't cancel out the noise.  I tried a pair of Monoprice noise canceling headphones.  The packaging and construction were first-rate, the noise canceling worked &#34;okay&#34;, but the sound quality just wasn't up to the Bose standards.  Even a pair of Bose AE2i headphones I received as a gift just didn't quite cut it.  The sound was good, of course, but the lack of noise canceling (and the seemingly inferior bass level) still left me wanting.  I tried a few others, too, looking for something with the noise canceling and sound quality I wanted.Finally, thanks to a used deal here on Amazon, I was able to pick up a pair of QC15s.  Life is good again.  No more noise from the laundry room.  No more hum from my computer.  Without music playing, blessed silence is all I hear.  I'm alone with my thoughts.  With music playing, I hear every detail of the music and vocals, without the addition of the rinse cycle or the monotonous hum of the dryer.I know that there are audiophiles out there who knock Bose for one reason or another, and while I respect their opinions and the reasoning behind them, the Bose QC line has always been the gold standard for me.  My music sounds great, and the noise cancellation is superb."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My previous pair was a JVC that I also purchased on Amazon ( much lower cost ) . This time when I was able to afford a Bose I decided to go for it . And it turns out to the best decision ever.The sound quality is amazing it does really tune out all the ambient noises and lets you listen to the crystal clear sound , whether it be music or watching a video or anything else.Sometimes I just want some peace and quiet while programming , and maybe not even listen to any music. Wallah , this pair of headphones does that , my JVC didnt . You dont even have to plug it into a source. Just put them on and turn them on to tune out ambient sound , best thing for concentrating on some thing without distractions.I am removing one star for a single reason of not being able to operate it without turning the noise canceling on. That is if you run out of battery while you are on the move thats it , you are done for , you cant use it until you get another battery. So carry spares always ."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It's amazing! I can reduce external noise and concentrate on whatever I am doing. All that staticky background noise disappears but I can *usually* still hear when people are speaking directly to me. They are comfortable over my ears, though on long-haul flights my head starts to feel kind of sore. The batteries last quite a long time and usually start making a clicking noise before they go entirely dead, so don't assume they are broken if you start hearing that. I can hear movies and music very well on noisy airplanes while using them, but often just flick them on and leave them unplugged to take advantage of the sound barrier it appears to create. Have I effectively turned them into really expensive earplugs? Yes... maybe I have. But only 50% of the time.I use these:- on the plane& in noisy airports- at work around loud machines- when surrounded by small children- anywhere I am trying to read- when the neighbors at my hotel were throwing a 4th of July partyI love them. The only downfall they have is their size, which makes it hard for me to rest my head comfortably to the side on airplanes or when lying down unless I have a pillow or something soft and flexible to organize around my head. Even with that detriment, they are still a travel staple."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If you have never heard the noise cancelling feature of these headphones you are missing something!The sound from background noise is totally muffled whether you are listening to music or not.Very relaxing!The actual speakers are as good or better than other non noise cancelling headphonesA bit expensive, but worth it!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Honestly, if you've never tried noise cancelling headphones before, try some out. It's just amazing.I use them at work since my office has a noisy kitchen area on one end, construction noise on the other, HVAC noise from above, and computer fans from below. With just the noise cancelling active, I can't hear the HVAC or computer fans. At all. It's like magic. I do need music or white noise to completely obliterate the rest of the noise, but even then, I almost always have the volume at one notch above mute."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"First up I will admit that I'm not a DJ, techno-wizard, or anything similar.  I am a person that travels a reasonable amount and sometimes ends up in some not-so-quiet locations.  I have found these headphones to be excellent.They are simple to use, with easy adjustment for either on-aircraft or off-aircraft use.  I have worn them for long periods without them feeling hot.  I prefer the over-ear design (particularly for protracted use).  I recently used these in some cramped accommodation that had ambient noise from a refridgerator, laundry and external generators; these headphones created an oasis of listening pleasure even at low volume levels, I had to turn the sound input off and even then it was difficult to hear the external sounds.If you are in a particularly hot location while wearing the headphones there may be some persperation where they contact your skin for a long time; pretty much like any other product on the planet when it is held against your skin under similar conditions.Prior to purchasing I had read that these headphones tended to ""push bass tones forward""; perhaps they do.  Bass is noticable with these on, but this was never such a problem for me that I even bothered adjusting the source output.Additionally the carry-case provided is actually a functional and useful product, unlike many of the cases that come standard with headphones.Overall so far I have found these to be an excellent product for listening to music, movies and podcasts."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"it was really hard to justify the extra cost, but listening to the demo in the Bose store convinced me that this is in a league of it's own.  The music that sounds so shallow from my iPhone sounds amazing in these babies!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"quite functionalreplacing the battery is kind of a painthe build quality is not as good as other headphonesoverall, they're awesomeI'd recommend it to someone who wants peace and quiet."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"We purchased Bose QuietComfort Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones in Bose store in (no-sales-tax) New Hampshire so we can try them out. The prices for Bose headphones we looked at are exactly the same in the store as they are on Amazon. For the bargain hunters the store also sells returned models at a $40 discount. The sales clerk told us that they are inspected and tested to perform as new.We compared two models Bose QuietComfort 15 and Bose QuietComfort 3. The two models were displayed together (Bose QuietComfort 3 is $50 more expensive). The displayed made us think that they might be similar. Bose QuietComfort 3 are lighter and do not cup the ears as well. As the result they did not perform as well.The headphones felt very comfortable to both of us, both of us got a nice fit without any adjustments. I did not feel my head was squeezed like with some other headphones. Headset cord is detachable if you want just noise cancellation you can remove the cord. The headphones come with a case to protect headphones while you travel.WHITE NOISE-----------The store has a set up that allows you to test the headphone in a noisy environment that simulates the airplane noise.Bose QuietComfort 15 - fantastic, totally blocks the soundBose QuietComfort 3 - could still hear it somewhatVOICE-----------I have tried Bose QuietComfort five-six years ago to see if I can cut out human voices for a noisy cube farm environment at work. But back then the I could hear the voices better with the headphones on then with the headphone off as the white noise cancelation made them more clear. This time when I put them on and asked my husband to speak to me I heard nothing just saw his lips moving. I actually thought he was playing a practical joke on me, and quickly lifted the headphone to catch him in his prank. But no, he was actually speaking. I ask the sales clerk about this dramatic improvement, and she said that human voices are much harder to block as their range is less predictable but Bose have made some improvements in this area. However Bose still does not advertise the headphones as voice canceling headphones as some voices may not be canceled as well.Bose QuietComfort 15 - excellent, some voices cannot hear at all, others are very muffledBose QuietComfort 3 - could still hear voiceMUSIC-----------Bose QuietComfort 15 - phenomenal at all ranges, best sound I ever heard in headphonesBose QuietComfort 3 - ok, the sound not as richBATTERY:-----------Bose QuietComfort 15 - standard AAA battery, 35 hours on play on one chargeBose QuietComfort 3 - rechargeable Li-ion battery, 25 hours of play on one chargeBose QuietComfort 15 headphones were a clear winner in each category. When I recently asked my husband if he has been using his new headphones a lot, he said he loves them but does not use them while he works as he cannot hear the phone. Funny, the phenomenal sound isolation at work!Ali Julia review"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The noise cancellation is great and they're comfortable.  That's about it.  You're paying for the Bose name.  I thought that I would have better sound with these than with my old Philips headphones and after about a minute of playing, I decided to return them.  I own a pair of SHN9500 Philips noise cancellation headphones that sound far better in sound quality, as well as they don't require the headphones be turned on to listen.  I'm looking at my Philips headphones thinking ""I'm sorry ... what was I thinking?""  Like what was mentioned before, the speaker material is sensitive to pressure and the sound changes when pressing the phones near the ears and even crackle (like if you're laying down).  Mine actually have a distortion, muffling sound out of one of the phones.  Not the quality I'd expect from Bose.To all that are happy with their's, have fun.  I'd implore you to try a pair of SHN9500's if you can.  Or not ... maybe you won't want to feel cheated either."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My office is located in a building that used to be a factory or a beer brewery at some point. Very high ceilings, festooned with two industrial-size air conditioners and adorned in large pipe work, produce never ending hum, which reflects from the walls and concrete. Whoooooo is what I hear all day. The noise level is high enough to drown out conversations two cubicles away from me. This hum is most irritating especially when you try to concentrate on programming software.The UPS Man arrived with my package from Amazon and I promptly extracted these headphones from the box. Popped the battery in put it on my head and flipped the switch. The silence is deafening. All hum is simply cancelled out. Just like that with a flip of a switch it was off and staid off all day. Interestingly enough I could still hear people talking near by, but all the hum and ambient noise simply went away. When at the end of my working day I took the headphones off my head I was surprised how loud the normal ambient noise is at the office.Listening to music in these headphone is also a joy. I do not have to crank it up loud to drown the ambient out. And the sound quality is very very good.The headphones are comfortable and soft, but perhaps not so comfortable if used in a room with 75F temperature because the ear pieces are closed of course.These headphones will not do you much good at a rifle range or if you work next to a pumping diesel engine, but they work well to cancel ambient sound. You can still hear normal conversation though it is muffled.This product does exactly what it say on the box."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The best headsets I have ever owned! The noise cancelling feature is awesome! One point though, you cannot turn off the noise cancelling feature, it will turn off the headsets and you won't be able to hear anything. I have not had my battery die yet but I'm guessing that when my batter dies I won't be able to use the headset until I put in a fresh battery. Other than that buy on!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Amazing headphones. They weren't cheap, but you pay for quality. Using them on flights (in place of the usless airline ones) gives a fantastic sound quality, eliminating all sound around you."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"There are enough reviews out there comparing various aspects of the QC 3 versus the QC 15 that I'll keep this review relatively brief and focus primarily on a comparison of sound quality.  Simply put, the QC 15 has a very noticeable advantage over the QC 3 when it comes to sound quality.  Because I purchased these headphones primarily for use when flying, I really wanted to like the QC 3 because of the smaller form factor and (slightly) more compact case.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't get past the relatively poor audio quality from the QC 3 headphones.  The headphones otherwise seem well designed, and the noise canceling feature seems to work well, but the audio quality was frankly disappointing.  I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality of the QC 3 was noticeably worse than the QC 15.  The best way I can describe it is that music sounds very flat, with no depth of sound stage.  The QC 15 is not exactly the best sounding headphones out there (hence, only 4 stars), but they provide noticeably better audio quality compared to the QC 3."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I guess I had really high expectations for this headphone, right now I am a bit disappointed.Noise canceling feature is great, but when you have too many varying elements of noises around (unlike a constant noise generating A/C or airplane motor), the quietness it introduces can easily become a restriction on its performance. Interestingly, and most likely unintended, the hissing noise in ATH-ANC7 filters out some of those noises. If you can get used to the hissing, then it may become a more distraction free listen. The reason I am mentioning all these is because ATH-ANC7 works great if you want to listen to music at a low volume. Bose, because of its synthetic silence and unnatural sound, does not give the same comfort.Sound quality is another feature where I am also a bit disappointed. For some reason, the clarity suffers as I decrease the volume and it does not feel like listening to a good headphone in a quiet (and to some extent acoustic) environment. At high volume, it works well enough, though it gets really uncomfortable after a while. What I can say is that its sound feels heavy (which some may consider as noticeably unnatural). For many of the albums that I listen to, I get the feeling that the sound is not right. This is where ATH-ANC7 definitely wins for me. I can use the Audio Technica all day long without any feel of discomfort in the musical pieces that I listen to. I have to give regular breaks with Bose, if I want to have a long experience (and even that does not help too much).Other than that, I think the design is cool. The cables look interesting and having low-high feature in sound is another interesting feature. And even though it is light and it does not cover your ears tightly it achieves a really good noise canceling performance.At this price, I would like to see a much better performance in sound quality and hopefully they will manage that with the next version(s)."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Got these for my long 13 hour flight. They were very comfortable. I wore them for almost the whole flight. The noise cancellation was very good. I wasnt able to hear the planes engine or the many babies that were crying near me on the flight. Sound quality is also great. Good bass but not overpowering in anyway. I like the fact that they come with the inline remote with mic that works with apple devices and also worked with samsung galaxy s3 except for the volume controls. Also comes with carrying case, extra cord without the remote/mic. The battery life is advertised as 35 hours from the one AAA battery. Didnt get a chance to test it out but still have enough to power the headphones after the 13 hour flight. I do have a few gripes about the headphones. They are expensive. Especially at $300. But if you fly alot or need very good noise cancelling headphones then these are the ones to get. I guess your also paying for the bose name for the most part. I do wish that I could still use these headphones passively without turning on the power or using battery. This is a feature in the AKG N 490's which also cost $50 less than the bose headphones. Overall great noise cancelling headphones and will probably last a lifetime given the bose quality and how well I take care of them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"They're quite comfortable--sort of: they're loose, and they move around, so it feels like they're going to fall off. They do a decent job with mid range. Bass is dramatically overdone. Trebble reproduction is an odious, smeary cacophony and the reason I returned them.Update:Twelfth time's the charm... Got a pair of Sennheiser HD25-1 II. They sound great (even with a lousy source like a smart phone) and block noise quite well without ""noise cancelling"". They're also quite a lot cheaper than the QC 15 and all parts are replaceable!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am impressed by Bose in all ways, I have had a bose home theatre for close to 5 years but then I needed a nice headphone so I bought the Quiet Comfort 15 and this is the best thing I did.Don't settle for less. Its worth the price."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel a lot on long, overnight flights with all the attendant noise you'd expect on a plane. These keep me sane. You can put them on and relax in your own cocoon of quiet. Buy them, take them on every trip, and when the babies start crying, or seat mates play their music too loud, or the pilot likes to narrate the trip, you will thank yourself immensely."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If you like your music loud you will hate these. I replaced them with Beats Studio but I think even those are gonna be returned as they feel cheap and I dont like the image/aesthetic of rap. (Different review) These Bose really cancel sound- its realy what u are paying for. ...even wind noise which most noise cancelling headphones can't manage these handle amazingly! however the bass is distorted and at the full vollume of my IPOD all frequencies are heavily distorted (and most bass even at low levels sound pretty bad). These are definately not for dubstep/trancestep (low frequency dives) or metal with double bass drum kicks. These 'phones may be fine for classical or mellow quiet use, definitely airline or other travel uses & some other location with a consistant droning outside noise. Very light & comfortable but genre dependent as far as sound pressure level and quality at higher volume."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"When it comes to noise cancellation Bose always stands ahead. Even though they have on-ear and in ear noise cancellation variants, I still feel the around ear more comfortable."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have owned quite a number of headphones over the years, including Dr Dre Beats (broken like most people had issues with).  Great sound, nice and big ear cups, long battery life!  Love them!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These sound no better than $25 dollar Sennheiser HD 202 II. And the build quality is no better either.Comfort is slightly better but for $300 more (tax included)... No way!Noise cancellation is not any better either than $25 dollar Sennheiser HD 202 II and the Senn's are just passive noise isolation. Plus with the Bose you need batteries.These headphones are a complete rip-off for $300. I would only pay $20-$30 dollars for these. No more.Look into some other brands like Sennheiser. They are a respected German audio company which caters to all budgets. For $300 dollars, you can buy Sennheiser's which will completely eat these overpriced headphones for lunch.They are other brands too. Please do your full research if you really are going to drop $300 on a pair of headphones because these Bose ones are all just marketing hype for uneducated consumers. You are not really getting $300 worth of sound nor worth of noise cancellation."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I purchased these for my son who is a minor league baseball player and so travels long distances on a cramped and noisy bus late at night and early mornings.  He has used a lot of headphone and said that these are the absolute best set of headphones he has ever had over his ears.  He told me that on the plane ride back he missed the drinks/snack because he could not hear the stewardess asking him what he wanted (which is really a good thing).  He tells me that the noise cancelling is the best he has ever used bar none.  Makes his trips so much easier/quieter/peaceful now.  He told me they are well worth every dollar spent.  I have tried them and can attest to the comfort and noise cancelling ability of this unit.  Would highly recommend.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"This mouse is a good mouse except for the picture is deceiving. The picture shows an all black mouse, but when I got it the mouse was a two tone color grey and black. This is the reason I gave this product only a 3 stars which if it would have matched the picture I would have given it a 5 star rating."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Hard to believe this is a Microsoft product. The buttons work OK, and it is a reasonably comfortable fit for the hand, but when you click the left button it sounds like a child's Cricket Clicker, much too loud. And it squeaks. I'm already looking for another brand of mouse."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,One of the most comfortable mice I've used. Great value for the price. I actually got another in a different color for my husband and he agrees.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"After 15 minutes of using this mouse, my right hand ached.  I'm on a computer several hours a day, and I generally have no issues with using a mouse.  This one has no contour to it whatever.  It's a semi-elipse.  Those with huge hands might like it.  If you're used to a contoured mouse, this one probably won't be what you want."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I find the mouse to be very comfortable and easy to use.  It is replacing a logitech mouse whose buttons were harder to press (more resistence) - the buttons on this mouse click easily and quickly.  The scroll wheel is easy to use and in nearly all things, the mouse lives up to the promise of being comfortable, consistent, and easy to use.I rate it a 4 star instead of 5 for two reasons:  1) the buttons when clicked are very loud.  My spouse has commented that it is annoying and he can hear it two rooms down when I am on the computer.  2) the scroll wheel doesn't click in sections - it just rolls freely.  I prefer a mouse with a scroll wheel that stops on a click after a full rotation.  It makes it easier to scroll when you have sections.Otherwise, I am very pleased with this mouse.  It replaces two Logitech mice that were too annoying to use."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,I had this mouse assigned at work and i loved it so much so i had to get one for myself at home !
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,i personally find this mouse to fit my hand really well.. and whats up with the haters who dont like smooth scroll wheel.. smooth scroll wheel totally rules.. get with the program.. the back and forward buttons are great and surprisingly microsoft has software for mac that makes this thing programmable.. cool beanz
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I bought 2 of these, and each makes a loud ""click"" noise when you click one of the buttons.  One of them must have a broken spring in it because it makes a sort of ""ping"" noise, which is louder but totally different from the other mouse.  If there are other people in the room with you it is very annoying.  The cord length and functionality are great, but the clicking noises make this a poor mouse."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Best mouse I've had.  After getting a replacement Apple mouse and trying others I finally found a winner.  Responds with a light touch to the wheel...many settings & compatible with my IMac.  Can program buttons as I wish with my Mac.  Especially like the back and forward buttons.  Like it so much I bought a spare!Update...3/11 - mouse acting squirrelly.  No squeak, neither mouse squeak or squirrel squeak, but erRATic behavior.  (Hope it's just this one, 'cause I bought a couple more.)"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Bought two of these, they work OK however with time it seems the chemicals from your hand effect the rubber material that the side grips are made from and deteriorates the rubber, leaving spots where your fingers are in constant contact. Logitech products do not appear to have this same issue. Does Microsoft even test there stuff anymore?????  I think the consumers are becoming the test dummies.  This defect should have been caught during Microsoft testing.  Both of these mice I bought have this problem. I recommend Logitech Mice as I have no problems with them."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,This mouse is identical to the gray mouse offered by Microsoft and it's less than half the price. So who cares about color? This mouse works exceptionally well. The blue laser works on everything except pure white. It also has four buttons and the scroll wheel has tilt control as well as the center switch. Plenty of function for most people. I bought two in case my dog eats one or my grandkids dunk it in their milk.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"as a mac user, since valve corp released steam and it's games for mac! I was looking for a cheap alternative of apple's mighty mouse ""wireless"" because the lack of accuracy and since I don't use it's features a lot! this mouse solved the problem, not to mention quicker at browsing the web! works on any surface! although it's a little awkward to me to see a PC equipment on a mac computer! this one is an exception!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I bought this for my wife who had problems using a tiny travel mouse for long periods of time. It was a perfect fit for her as she should stretch out her fingers.  The mouse plugged in and immediately worked with no problems. Good price, good buy"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,I have two of these for use where space is an issue. I use them with a lap top and a note book.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,20 bucks for a mouse that made it less than three months. The FileMate costs around 7 bucks and lasts me about a year. The wire frayed and loosened after about 7 weeks and the whole thing went south a week or so later. Time for a new one; this time it will be another FileMate.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I bought two of these. I got the ""Strawberry"" color because it was the cheapest. It's actually a light pale pink, so it's not too garish. They mice function quite well and they are comfortable for my small hand. There are two buttons on both sides of the mouse that are fully customizable."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I started using this mouse recently and have started liking it. There is nothing bad about this mouse and all its features work excellent. I recently stopped using my wireless keyboard and mouse because of it connectivity/sleep activation and precision issues in case of mouse (wireless). I ordered Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 Keyboard as it was the best available wired keyboard from Mircosoft. Strangely it wasn't sold along with a mouse of same style and looks. So after looking for a while, I came across this mouse and thought of giving a try. They both go well looks wise. Following points would describe its pros and cons;PROS:- Professional looks. Excellent styling and looks.- Quality material. It has a mat finish and not glossy.- Guaranteed precision pointing. Perfect movement and precision pointing which was one of the reason I moved to wired components.- Scroll wheel is amazingly smooth and works perfectly fine. Important point to note is, download its configuaration software from [...]Once you install this software cum drivers, you can configure the scroll wheel according to your requirement. I read reviews about scroll wheel not working properly but it's incorrect. Horizontal and Vertical scrolling works absolutely fine. Though remember it's a smaooth scroll and there is no clicks when you scroll vertically. I love it.- Left button and Right button can be set in the configuaration software to ease our tasks. The default assigned purpose of these buttons is to go Forward and Back while browsing.- So called its BlueTrack technology works well on wooden desk, paper and leather like material. Though keep in mind the mouse works on a light beneath it, so it won't work on transperent glass or mirrored surface according to the manual.- Plug and play, No hassel. Basic feature like vertical scroll and pointer started working out of the box. For all other extra features install the software from the above link.- Fairly priced, may be on the cheaper side.CONS:- Personal opinion: the width on top of the mouse is bigger than most of them available in the market. I have a small hands though it's not a big deal, I may get used to it soon.Overall:As expected from Microsoft, this product is a well built product with pro looks and that is why I prefer Microsoft over any other brand (even Logitech). Yes it costs more but what you get is what you pay for. I am a Software Engineer and have ordered this mouse for daily use at home. No more the mouse sleeps or looses its smooth pointing and also no more battery issues.Though I recommend not to forget the installation of the software cum driver from Microsoft's website. Check out the images I have uploaded. So far satisfied. If I found any issues, I will update this review.Happy pointing and scrolling :)."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"the mouse tracks very nicely, but I find the wheel totally horrible.  It rolls readily & totally smoothly -- i.e. no ""clicks"" and no resistance whatsoever -- ironically making scrolling far from effortless.  After correcting for the vague over- or underscrolling that's to be expected en route to the desired scroll amount, one has to be very careful/attentive not to brush the scroll wheel and inadvertently scroll more when placing a hand on, or removing a hand from, this mouse.One reason I got this mouse was because of the tilt-wheel switches, but I don't use the side-tilts for the same reason:  inadvertent scrolling during lateral movement.(Inadvertent scrolling is also an issue to be careful about when using the wheel to middle click.)After enough accidental clicks of the side button; they're now disabled, too.  .... or maybe not.  I just reached to do something with the mouse, inadvertently both moved the wheel *and* touched a side button, and found the text size on the page suddenly got bigger.  Bizarrely, I find I can only make text bigger, not smaller!!! so hopefully I can resolve this by revisiting the configuration SW.Also, you have to download the SW from the web.  Fine; but the web site provides 2 software components for this mouse, and installation of the second fails, as it says a newer version of this SW is already installed on my Win7 box.  I can't find that 2nd package in my start menu nor in the installed programs list, so I don't know what's up with that.Also -- and I don't know if this is something in Google Chrome or with this mouse, but -- I find Chrome's responsiveness to this mouse slow.  This is something I never noticed with my previous mouse -- or any other mouse/app combination ever before on any machine, for that matter.  for example, I middle click 2 adjacent links to open them in new tabs:  the 1st link opens in a new tab, but -- even though I clicked it while the mouse cursor was over it -- the 2nd middle click is processed as if it occurred in the space between the 2 links.Bottom line recommendation:  find something else."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"What can I say, this is a great, 'strawberry' mouse.  I don't mind the color and at a significant discount to the black one.  It works well, I would recommend this line of mice to anyone and everyone!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I will leave my original review intact below, but after a year and two months I became fed up with this mouse and bought a new one. Here are the reasons why:First, while the construction felt sturdy, it did not hold up. The black part of the body is covered in rubber which soon began to break down. It now looks terrible, pitted, and worn.The other major flaw of this mouse is the scroll wheel. Rather than the rubber coated wheel I am used to it has a wheel with a rubber band around the outside of it. This band soon became malformed and would come off the wheel, interfering with the scroll mechanism. Not long after that, the rubber itself began to break down, leaving gooey, black clumps behind, often gumming up the scroll mechanism. The problems with scrolling were just not worth continuing to use this mouse. Microsoft used to make excellent mice, but I have moved on to other companies now that they have stepped down their game. What happened to the quality of the Intellimouse?I also never really did get used to the free scrolling wheel, though I did like it in some situations.If you're looking for a good mouse check out the Logitech G400, it is what I replaced this one with. I'm sure that Logitech's other offerings are of similar good quality.----------Original review:I got this mouse to replace the Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical that I have happily been using for years now. It had become my favorite mouse but they have stopped making it so I had to find a new option. Having used a few notebook mice I knew that a small mouse was out of the question for my big hands--extended use of a small mouse makes my hand hurt so I had to look for a full-sized option.I toyed around with the idea of a full-sized wireless mouse but was unable to find one that had the button configuration I was looking for and I was concerned with weight and reception quality, so I decided to go for a wired mouse and the Comfort Mouse 4500 has a similar button configuration to the old IntelliMouse Optical (five buttons: the two normal ones, middle click on the scroll, and one on either side for forward and back in the browser). In addition to this it also has the horizontal scroll on the wheel which I thought might be a nice, if rarely used, feature.First impressions:Size - The size of this mouse is great, similar to the one it replaced. It fills my hand perfectly so I think I'll have no problems using it for extended periods of time.Shape - The shape is a little more squared off on top, which is a bit less comfortable for my ring finger than the curves of the IntelliMouse optical.Button layout - The side buttons are much smaller than on the IntelliMouse Optical, but still very convenient to my thumb and ring finger. The middle click button under the wheel is very firm, I wish it was a bit looser. (It may become easier with use.)Wheel - My one complaint about this mouse is the wheel. It has a free-scrolling wheel rather than a stepped clicking wheel. While this *is* better than the very firm click some mouse wheels I've tried have had, it is a bit disconcerting at first. The free-scrolling makes it very hard to ctrl-scroll zoom websites accurately. Perhaps I will get used to it. The free-scrolling combined with the firm middle click means that I tend to scroll while trying to middle click which could, perhaps, lead to problems.Side scrolling - I've never used a mouse with this feature and I don't foresee using it a terrible lot. I imagine it would be useful for large spreadsheets and such. It isn't a very natural motion to me (perhaps I would have said the same of scrolling fifteen years ago?) and since the wheel is free-scrolling it tends to scroll vertically a little bit while I'm using the side scrolling.Tracking - The BlueTrack technology seems to work well. It tracks equally well on my cloth covered mouse pad, wooden desk, and a glossy book cover. The only thing I tried on which it wouldn't track was a mirror. The response is perfect for me and I've got the pointer speed set about where it was for the last mouse I used. Precision seems excellent.Other - I like the overall look of the mouse, and the fact that it doesn't have the annoying extra LED that they used to feel was needed to let everyone in the world know you were using an optical mouse. This mouse only has two ""feet"", larger than the four mice of the past have used, and that seems to work just fine. Maybe they won't come unstuck from the bottom as quickly. I like the rubberized grip (the black part is rubberized).Final thoughts:This mouse is a great replacement for a full-sized mouse with similar button layout. It fits a large hand perfectly and is also ambidextrous for those who need a left-handed mouse. The only major drawbacks are the free-scrolling wheel and overly firm middle click button. The slightly angular design of the body is a minor drawback.Pros - Size (perfect for large hands!), ambidexterity (for left-handed mouse users, of which I am not), button layout, tracking, look.Cons - Free-scrolling wheel, firm middle click, angular design not comfortable (a bit ironic considering the name, but you can't please everyone)."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Cute and well made, my girlfriend loved it.Fwd and Back buttons are nicely positioned and you dont hit them by accident.The mouse is thicker than you think it would be (more bulbous) and works very well!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I bought this mouse to replace another Microsoft, the 1058, thinking I was buying a wireless mouse. My mistake, no fault of the manufacturer. So, right off the bat, I don't like the cord. It's constantly rubbing over something on my desk (which is not that neat!), a sound that bothers me, or gets caught on something, which slows down use of the mouse. It's also made of some sort of soft material -- rubber? -- that is perpetually sticky, even after I try to wipe it down. For ergonomic reasons, I wanted the longest mouse I could find, but this one is short and fat enough (height-wise) to cause me pain in my wrist. I've rigged up the old mouse receiver with adhesive poster putty to create a wrist rest so that my wrist isn't constantly in a bent position. It's a pretty clunky solution. I've been looking on ebay for a 1058, which is no longer made, but so far no luck. I hope to replace my old mouse soon!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Overall this is a pretty sold mouse, especially for the price.However, if you use AutoCAD or any similar program that uses the wheel button as a click-pan, this is NOT the mouse for you.With or without the extra software, clicking the wheel will pan, but there's a lag of about 0.1-0.2 seconds.This sounds trivial, unless you're drafting at full speed, then it's maddening and useless."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I got this as a new mouse for a new system I built. (all amazon parts!) I like the way the sensors are set an an angle so that you can use in on various surfaces.as I &#34;upgrade&#34; my other computer systems, I will be buying more of these!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,This was a gift for my Honey Love. This is a fairly big mouse for a female hand. She says it fits her hands great. We bought this mouse as a replacement for a wi-fi mouse. I highly recommend this mouse. It tracks well and was easy to install. Excellent buy for the price.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I love this mouse! It is very cute, but also very good quality, and the settings are very simple to change! The scroll wheel sensitivity was awful when I plugged it in, and I just slowed it way down and it is perfect! Good gaming mouse, too. Love this!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"For what I paid , this mouse is doing a great job.Very accurate and comfortable for photoshop.I'd definitely recommend this product to others."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,Use this mouse as a spare in my travel laptop bag. Works like a charm on any surface. Plug and play with both Windows 7 and windows 8/8.1.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Bought this mouse for work.  We use laptops on docking stations.  While I have a wireless mouse, it is a mobile one, so a littlre smaller in size.  I wanted a full size mouse for where I do a majority of my work.  Wired just makes sense in that situation, as its always plugged into the docking station.The mouse has a great ergonomic shape and contours to the hand very nicely.  The two extra buttons on the side are great for foward and back, or can be customized if you choose to install Inetellipoint software (comes with mouse or download from MS).  The mouse behaves great.  Have had it for a couple weeks now.  The only complaint I have is that the wheel is not a click wheel.  There is no resistance in the scroll wheel at all.  I prefer to have the wheel click.  Also, the wheel is smooth, no grips.Overall though, my two complaints arent even enough to drop from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I love this mouse."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I went to the Microsoft website looking for an ergonomic wired mouse. They recommended this mouse to me.This mouse sucks. I'm close to throwing it in the trash.1. The middle button response is very laggy. Most of the time, I need to click it 3 times to register 2 clicks.2. The scroll wheel is overly sensitive. It doesn't feel good even when scrolling web pages.3. The mouse cursor too much when I lift it off the table.Really! I am better off using the trackpad on my laptop. First, the media keyboard and now this. I am very disappointed in Microsoft hardware lately."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Mouse arrived as promised. It works great as a good mouse should. The color is awesome, my wife and my daughter are delighted with it. And the price was the deal maker, so keep up the good work."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I needed it for my laptop, as my pad is about to give up the ghost. After looking around for a bit, I decided on this one for the price, and the supposed comfort of the design. It didn't let me down. It fits exactly into the palm of my hand. As I use my computer for hours at a time, especially for editing, this is perfect for me. Comfort counts!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I normally use a naga gaming mouse because it has so many buttons i can macro.  However, it has had a glitch with the system that i would have to re-plug it every time i turned on my pc.  Got tired of doing that so I bought this very simple and basic mouse and I am absolutely pleased with the performance. Even though I lost 12 extra buttons by switching to this mouse I will bear with it because this new mouse is so smooth and accurate. I love how the wheel glides and it tilts as well."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"This is a good mouse.  Very accurate tracking.  It has a similar button layout to an Intellimouse.  So if you are used to the 4th and 5th button locations on opposite sides like the Intellimouse, it will feel natural.My only complaint is the scroll wheel.  It feels tight and smooth when moving, but it is not smooth on the screen.  It is jumpy and catchy. It will sometimes jump back a little bit after you have moved it, even if you are carful not to move the wheel back.  It is difficult to keep it accurate. When used for gaming it becomes really problematic.I wanted the newer tracking technology, but I am considereing going back to my old Intellimouse strictly to regain the accuracy of the scroll wheel."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I love this mouse. It's very comfortable to hold and very precise. Takes no time for me to get used to it. The scrolling wheel is very smoooth. I understand the complaint of hte wheel click as a middle button, but I never used it, so it doesn't bother me. the Most often used buttons other than the main 2, are the forward and backward buttons. They are not as big as the original MS optical mouse side buttons, but they are less likely to be clicked accidentally. So far I love this mouse and have no complaints."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Nice color, good variety of buttons, but absolutely the worst scroll wheel experience around. It'll scroll up unexpectedly while scrolling down. Sometimes it'll start scrolling all by itself! and the center click and double center click features work only when they want to. An absolute nightmare to work with in photoshop.I don't like this H.I.D. (Human Irritation Device). Sending it back right away!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I just love the five separate, programmable buttons. And the new hi-res laser and detector work great on any surface, even shiny ones. It's also light and glides easily. No flaws at all, really. Great mouse."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"This mouse is replacing an old Apple Mighty Mouse. The mouse is very comfortable and tracks accurately. The scroll-wheel is &#34;loose,&#34; it doesn't click or buzz when you scroll. Sideways scrolling doesn't work very well on Mac (scrolls very slow). I'm used to using &#34;shift&#34;+scroll so it's no big deal. Its a little tall for my hand, but much more comfortable than a Mighty Mouse. I like the rubber material.It gets 4 stars because the sideways scrolling doesn't really work."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I like the Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500. It fits my hand nicely. The key pads are responsive. The scroll wheel is a little fast, so it takes a little time to get used to it.I like this mouse better than my Microsoft Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer that gave out after a few years of service.All in all, this is a great mouse with a solid warranty! What more can you ask?Best, Jim"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,This mouse is well made and has a nice design. Its a little larger in the palm area which I feel makes a great resting place for your hand. The wheel has a great feel and its super accurate.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,Works well with my Mac and a nice compliment to my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard. I can honestly say money well spent.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Purchased this from amazon on Sep 1, 2012. The rubber on the base of the mouse and on the scroll wheel started falling apart around February. As of April 24, it is in completely unusable condition."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Feels great in my hand....also, very responsive.  The price cannot be beat!  Order one just to have a spare around when you need it."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"The Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500 does the job I need.  The last mouse I had did not work well so I decided to go with a wired instead of wireless to see if that was better.  And, it is.  Also, more comfortable."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I do like this mouse. The scroll-wheel aspect that others have mentioned, the &#34;smooth-scroll&#34; feature, is pretty obnoxious. Forget art/photo editing, and gaming takes quite an adjustment. The buttons on either side are way too easy too click, but you adjust.That said, it feels nice with a slightly-rubberized grip (the black section), and is a great size for my hand (large-ish for a woman, but smaller than most men). The color is a NICE pale pink (not too &#34;Barbie&#34; or red or kiddish), and it has a comfortable weight to it (neither heavy nor light). I wouldn't be embarrassed to have this sit on my desk at work, either, unlike many of the pink mice I've seen for sale. AND, it's wired! I'm not a fan of Bluetooth mice, so this is nice.I'd definitely recommend this mouse. For an &#34;adult-looking&#34; pink functional mouse, I'm very happy I found this!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,A basic mouse.  Works like a mouse should.  I bought 12 for a business.  No complaints since it does what it should.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I liked the original Intellimouse alot, but mine was getting pretty oldfor the $8 including shipping (Prime) on this Microsoft product, with the same laft and right 'go back' 'go forward' buttons I was used to, I decided to give it a flyIt's great! I mean, there are more expensive mice out there with better ergonomics perhaps or maybe not this goofy pink color, but who cares, for an $8 brand name mouse which works flawlessly with Windows, is very smooth an accurate, and at this price, how can you go wrong (you cant)If you are looking for an under $10 mouse that you want to be sure will work and is of good quality I challenge anyone to find a better answer"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I purchased this for my mother to use with her laptop.  As has been mentioned, the middle wheel button can be hard to depress and it can feel a bit odd with the smooth scrolling wheel.  Overall, it is a great mouse for the price and works very well for normal use."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,he likes it. Says it works good. Happy with it and not minding the wires on it at all. :)
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Can't complain. Got this for a good price, expected something really cheap, and got something I'd consider twice as valuable for the price.Great tracking, excellent feel, good button response. Can't go wrong."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Both products failed to have the mouse function.  This was using computers with brand new motherboards and new chipsets, new cpu's.  Have bought Microsoft mouse products since they became available years ago.  All previous mouse products had packed with them a driver for the mouse.  These products had a very complicated method to download drivers from Microsoft.  Spent a day working with those downloadable drivers.  Still do not have a working product.  I do admit that on one particular computer that I built around 10 years ago, the model 4500 would work as a mouse.  But no operation on relatively new computers.  Testing was done with Windows XP and Windows 7.  If I get these to work after a few days of fiddle with the mouse, I will describe the problems IF it is possible to get the units working, and on multiple computers."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,don't like the feel and the side buttons are on the sensitive side ... the wheel doesn't work like some of the others I've had.  Looks good on the screen but just wasn't the mouse for me.  I wouldn't buy another regardless of the price.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I was looking forward to this, as it's the model Microsoft currently makes that most resembles my beloved and discontinued Comfort Mouse 3000.I've used many mice with extra side buttons, and have never had any problems. On this model, I was baffled to find that Microsoft decided to move the side buttons up to virtually the same positions where your fingertips hold the mouse. I'm a reasonably dextrous person&#8212;I play several musical instruments, and am a fast typist&#8212;but I could NOT use this mouse without regularly and unintentionally pressing the side buttons. What could be more distracting than clicking things you didn't mean to, or having the context menu pop up unbidden?A disappointment. If you're considering this mouse, be sure to find one you can try first."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I've never used a mouse I've totally loved, but this is as good as any I've had.It would be worth full price, and if you don't mind an odd color,  you may be able to get it for less, I got a red for under $10.Smooth operation, very quiet. Middle button (pushing down on scroll wheel) is a little hard to push, might be an issue for someone who uses that a lot- I don't. Left/right buttons seem a little cheesy, but no problems noted.Got two, one for work and one for home, so I don't have to get used to different mouses (yes, mice)Be sure to download drivers from MS, easy to find, for full operation."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I have become used to using side buttons on prior mice. Unfortunately I can no longer find the old models I've gotten accustomed to. This mouse is OK, but it is not ergonomically designed. The side buttons are not where my fingers normally expect them to be."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Bought this to have a cheap, temporary mouse until I could afford a nice gaming mouse.Plugged it in to multiple USB ports, tried to download the drivers for it, but nothing worked. Mouse was DOA.Even if it did work, the mouse scroll is horrible and I can see that the other reviewers are correct, this mouse wouldn't survive long.I am extremely proficient with computers, having built dozens of systems and maintained many more over the last fifteen years."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I had been a very happy Microsoft Intellimouse user for years.  Recently the left button on the mouse started acting up so I decided it's time to replace the mouse.  I could no longer find the Intellimouse online or at any local stores such as Best Buy, Target or Staples.  At first I bought a Logitech Wireless mouse M510 and found it heavy and less responsive than a wired mouse (I guess this should be expected since it's wireless?)I then purchased this Comfort Mouse 4500 at a local store and this mouse is a disappointment.  The mouse feels too big and is too high for resting my palm comfortably.  The wheel makes very loud noise when using middle click and is rather hard to press.Microsoft please give us back the high-quality Intellimouse!  I am more than willing to pay the higher price for its quality, functions, ergonomics and feel.Skip Comfort Mouse 4500..."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I needed a new five button mouse and have had good luck with Microsoft mice in the past.  The Comfort Mouse 4500 sounded like it would be the right mouse for me, despite the somewhat negative reviews here.  I though ""How can a Microsoft mouse be as bad as this one sounds?""  So I bought one, figuring it would be just fine.  It is not.Like quite a few reviewers say here, the scroll wheel is a pain; there are no detents in its travel and simply moving the mouse can cause the wheel to scroll.  I use the middle button A LOT and trying to click it when the wheel ""slips"" provides a horrible experience.  The back button is also place too far forward to be useful; I have to rotate my entire hand clockwise to get my thumb on the button, which pushes all of my other fingers off their respective buttons.  A better way of placing the back button would be to have its front edge placed where the current button's trailing edge is now. The forward button on the right side of the mouse happens to be too far rearward to be effective. If its trailing edge were where the current button's leading edge is, it would make for a usable button. Maybe making the mouse smaller would also help, as buttons couldn't be so far apart from one another.These negatives combine to yield a mouse that is effectively a three button mouse, and a not particularly good one at that.Will I return it?  No, because the mouse cost only $10 and I hate the pain of having to repackage everything and stopping at the UPS Store.My search continues."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,Wheel started to bind up. Found it impossible to open unit and clean it out. Good news is that it is cheap enough that I simply bought another one. Performance very competitive and versatility is excellent.

Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Awesome little TV that I use in my kitchen.  I love everything except that it only has no buttons to control channels, volume, no/off.  Instead, it has a joystick in the back of the TV (lower left corner).  You have to push it to bring up a menu and then move it in one of four directions to do what you want using the pop up menu on the screen.

Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Great unit, no drawbacks, THIN with a very good picture...it's a winner for the price.I do wish the remote had a light...I'd been happy to have paid another five bucks for a remote I could see in the dark.  Beyond that preference, no complaints, it's a greatvTV."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I bought this tv for an exercise room and hoped the speaker volume would be enough to overcome the treadmill noise. Not only was it loud enough but the tv has a setting in the sound menu called Clear Voice that emphasizes voice over sounds. This makes it much easier to understand what people are saying while on the treadmill. It also has a setting called Auto Volume that automatically adjusts the volume to the same level on all channels.I am using the tv with a small roof top antenna and it gets all the stations from a 56 mile distance. I compared this tv's channel reception to my more expensive Toshiba Regza 46XV645U and they were both the same, so my worries of a cheap tv having an inferior tuner were over.The base of the tv is not adjustable but was quite sturdy and level. The back has a 75mm by 75mm vesa mount so it could be mounted with something like this mount:Cheetah Mounts ALAMB Articulating Arm TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 12-24"" LCD LED Flat Screen Monitors Display/TVs up to 40lbs Includes Free 10' HDMI Cable and 6"" Bubble LevelI mounted this tv up high and used a feature in the picture menu called Samsung Magic Angle. This has settings to adjust the picture quality to compensate for the tv not being close to level line of sight. This brought the picture back to the same quality as if I were looking at it straight on. This feature could also be used if the tv were mounted real low.The quality, picture, and sound of this tv were above my expectations for a tv at this price.Update:After 1 year the tv is still going strong with no issues. I am very happy with this purchase."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I bought this tv to install in my master bathroom so I can watch the news in the morning when I am getting ready for work.  We were doing a bathroom remodel and decided this was the perfect time to install it on the wall.  Perfect size for what I needed.  Great picture and sound as well.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I bought this for a small recess in Mrs. Spudman's sewing room. the TV fits perfectly and was a cinch to set up.  It's almost as simple as plug and play. There are plenty of options for picture and sound, but we are happy with the picture as is and have no desire to tinker with whatever works. Those who use this device as a monitor might want to explore the sound and picture options.I bought a HDMI cord for best picture, but our cable box doesn't have that connection. Coaxial cable connects the TV and cable box for us with satisfactory results.The plastic base is attached with four screws, a tedious chore since the screw access is so recessed. A magnetic screwdriver would have made things much easier for me.Bottom line - We are both pleased with our little Samsung television which so far demonstrates the Samsung performance we expected."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I purchased two of these in the 19-inch size to replace the two 15-inch Toshibas I had in my kitchen and on my desk.  Our cable co is going to boxes only - no more through the wall cable, only cable through boxes starting in February.  Got the boxes and decided I needed to replace mine (although they are great little TVs) with something that has HDMI ports.So, I am extremely pleased with the picture and the sound for these TVs.  Without the HDMI it was ok, but since the cable box has HDMI (and I guess they have gone to all HD now, as long as you have the cables - woo hoo!) I figured I'd do better using that, over the a/v cables, so I got a couple of the Amazon Basics HDMI cables (great cables - I use them all over my house!) and made myself a better hook up for both of these little TVs.  It's stunning.The TV's menu has a lot of picture, sound, etc, choices.  It seems like a really good little remote, so I'm kind of sad I have to use those big, clunky, Charter remotes.Fortunately, I read several reviews and one thing that seemed to be apparent was that attaching the stand could be problematic.  I did what one reviewer recommended and screwed the screws into the television first.  Then  I took them out and attached the stand, screwing it in.  Having done that it was pretty easy.  I did it on my own, without anybody else to help.  I've attached the stands for all the TVs in my house, so I was fairly familiar with the process.  I just lay the TV, face down, on a soft towel on my dining room table - with the bottom end at the edge of the table.  That makes it pretty easy to get the stand on.  Then I get one of the screws in about three quarters of the way so that I have stability and then do the rest, and tighten everything up.So, the reason I gave it only four stars is that the stand for this TV is slightly sub-standard.  The stands on my 15-inch Toshibas were way wider and more stable.  I'd be sure that this TV is not where kids or animals can access it because I feel like you could knock it over with a feather.  It's not a deal-breaker because it will be ok but I wish the stand were wider."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,We got this to replace a slightly smaller kitchen TV.  This unit is great viewing off axis and is much brighter.  It is connected to an over the air antenna and picks up 36 channels that are sharper and more colorful than the cable company.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"We're using this in our kitchen and it is great for this purpose.  It is low enough to fit under cabinets but screen is large enough to watch from across the room and sound quality  is very good.  Lots of controls for picture settings, picture quality is also very good.  It was harder than expected to screw the base to the TV but once the screws are firmly seated the stand is sturdy enough.  No regrets on this purchase!"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Just got this from Amazon a few days ago. Nice picture and audio is good. There are not that many choices for 19&#34; models. I think this one is probably as good as it gets.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I needed a tv for the kitchen while I cook.  This works really well.  The picture quality is very good for such a small tv.  Good for watching cooking shows or just multi tasking while emptying out the dishwasher.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Perfect set for our RV. Picture quality is very good and the set fits in a small space.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Just as I expected, did good. Thank you, fits perfect, perfect screen, etc."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I run video in our church, and while we have expensive equipment, the monitor in the control booth is poor quality.  It is difficult to tell if the camera exposure is correct using this poor quality TV.  When I play recordings at home afterward, the picture looks different from when viewing it live.  I was looking for a TV to use as a monitor that would match the picture on my JVC professional CRT monitor.  I spent several hours adjusting the settings, and finally got a very close match to my professional monitor.  The factory settings look awful, so adjustments are necessary to get a really good picture.  Like other reviews, I found the stand to be flimsy, and difficult to get the screws tight enough.  By doing some hard turning of the screw driver, I was able to get the stand tightly fastened. The stand has a nice glossy finish, but is not as strong as the one on my older Samsung TV.  It seems that as the TVs become lighter in weight, the stands are also lighter.  Here are the settings I used.  They worked for me.  The TV was on a small table that was slightly lower than my line of sight.  My settings were based upon this angle..Mode:  StandardMagic Angle : Standing ModeBack Light : 20Contrast : 95Brightness : 52 (for component and HDMI, 65 for composite)Sharpness : 50Color : 40 (for component, 38 for HDMI, 44 for composite)Tint : (G/R)  G40/R60Dynamic Contract : OffBlack Tone : OffFlesh Tone : -2Color Space : NativeWhite Balance : No changeGamma : 0Motion Lighting : OffColor Tone : StandardSize: 4:3 (using TV for SD video)Digital Clean View : OffMPEG Noise Filter : AutoLED Clear Motion : OffHDMI Black Level : Normal (works only for adjusting HDMI mode)I found the Magic Angle to be a big help.  With this turned off, the picture looked washed out.  These settings did work for me. However, they may not be ideal for everyone."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I use this as an extra laptop dual monitor. It is not as clear as the one on my laptop but it is adequate. I lost the remote and I do not know how to turn it off. It powers off by itself from lack of use,"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Easy to set up and program.  I'm very happy with it.  Excellent picture quality.  I think anything Samsung is excellent.  Have a Samung camera that is awesome, taking pictures and videos.  There is one little annoyance.  When turning the TV on or off, there is a little musical sound, sort of like when Windows starts on a computer.  Perhaps there is a way to turn it off that I don't know about.  Never-the-less, a five star product."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I needed an LED TV to replace my aged (1997)  27&#34; table mounted TV because of space limitations.  This TV fit perfectly up in the corner between a closet and a window.  The TV was easy to set up and the picture quality is great. I bought this TV because I am a long-time Samsung user and I have been very pleased with all the Samsung products I have (cameras, refrigerator, mp4 player, etc)."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"A little smaller and not quite the quality I wanted, but you cant beat the price, and all in all, I would buy it agin! Contrary to other reviews there is a on of button on the back of the TV it is also a multi function and aside from changing the volume and channel it can do almost every thing that the actual remote can do from changing the source to changing the brightness."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Excellent HD picture for our kitchen counter.  Although not quite as clear as the much larger 32 and 40 inch LED's elsewhere in the house, this works well under our kitchen cabinets."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Very happy with my purchase.  The TV is exactly the size I had been looking for due to my limited space.  And the picture is just gorgeous, colors exceptionally vivid, over and above what I had expected.  A light weight monitor, literally plug and play to my DirecTV sat box, and voila! gorgeous picture!  And Amazon's price can not be beat by anyone out there, whether an online retailer or a brick and mortar store - are you listening BestBuy?  Or should we call you WorstBuy?"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I'm old enough to remember when computers were huge machines, and TV screens were 60&#34; wide or even larger!  Now through the miracle of miniaturization, you can get a great television set which measures only 19&#34; across!!  I am delighted, but wonder if I had waited another year or so, could have gotten one even smaller."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,This is our first LED set and my wife likes it a lot but I have to say I'm less of a fan. It is nice and compact and I'm sure will last a long time but the picture seems to me to lack depth. If I look at a really good LCD or plasma picture it really feels like I am seeing the actual person or event and not just an image of same. With this TV I know I'm looking at an image and it just doesn't give me the same pleasure. I may get used to it but I'll watch my others for anything longer than a bowl of cereal.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,still getting used to the channel numbers using the built-in digital tuner. 123-4 still seems a strange number for CBS
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I am so impresed with Samsung, this is my second small TV from them.CONS Does not automatically adjust to the screen size input. There is a manual control which works fine, but needs setting."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Its an awesome TV! Perfect for our entertainment center. We needed a new TV and were not looking into getting rid of our entertainment center. This TV was just big enough to fit. The picture is beautiful. I don't know what 1080p looks like but coming from an old tube TV I probably wouldn't know the difference. My only complaint is that it doesn't have an audio out. But considering the limitations we had this was the best there is. I would recommend this product if you don't care about the audio out. It does have a mini headphone jack.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Great little TV. Nice picture. Stable on the kitchen counter. Easy to set up. I replaced a small old TV with it, and now my kitchen looks more neat and orderly."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Nice high quality TV with plenty of inputs.  Samsung as usual is one of the leaders when it comes to television
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I needed a small tv for the spare bedroom, and this is perfect. The stand is easy to attach, and the setup is very fast and simple.The picture is fantastic, just tweak the settings to get it to your liking.The sound is also great- all I had to do was set DTS TruSurround to ON and Auto Volume to ON.Highly recommend this tv for anyone looking for a small tv without all the bells and whistles."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"It may be because of my advanced years, but I had to get a sound bar to hear the TV perfectly.  Then, I got a universal remote to avoid the four I was using.  That is why I gave the TV 4 stars instead of 5, because I am well=pleased with the picture and the TV. in general."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,We needed a small tv for a hobby room. Space was an issue. Really easy setup and great support from Samsung customer service if you have a question. Excellent picture quality and good sound for a small set. Really happy with it.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Great picture and great size for my kitchen viewing.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Samsung products are affordable and are of good quality. Got this for my RV, put it on a swivel mount and love it. Would buy this product again."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Love this little TV. I received it for free as part of a promo when I purchased their flagship 51 inch top of the line Plasma TV. That being said, it can't compare to that one and it shouldn't be. I threw this TV into a den until we get a larger TV in there, then this will move to a bedroom. I am impressed with the picture quality and especially the speakers. For under $300 in a small room this TV works great."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Recently purchased this tv for my bedroom & I really like it. Has a great picture. The settings take a little time to figure out but not that complicated.If you're interested in the alarm feature (like I was), you need to know that it does not work right with HD cable channels. The tv will turn on to fuzz if the cable signal is connected through the cable box and it needs to be set up this way to get HD channels. If you have basic cable only with the cable signal connected to the back of the tv the alarm should turn onto to a basic tv channel. Took some time of going back & forth with customer service to finally figure this out. Back to an old fashioned alarm clock."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Mounted it on an arm in the kitchen so my girl can watch Jeopardy while she cooks.  fits under the cabinet and has a DC power supply that I velcroed to the back so that it swings with the TV.  This TV has DUAL HDMI inputs as opposed to many of the reviews online that state it only has 1.  Also has a coax that I hook into my HDTV OTA antenna on the roof to pull in 130+ digital channels for free.Please note that the VESA 75 mounting holes are near the top of the TV which means you need to allow for an extra few inches of room with most hinge mounts.  I did not have enough on my countertop so I opted for a horizontal arm style mount.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I have rated this unit four stars only because of limited use so far. I fully expect this to be a 5-star purchase.I needed a relatively small flat-panel TV for a guest bedroom. I have a Samsung LCD in my family room and have been pleased with it. (No problems so far after five years of use.) Consumer Reports and reviews here on Amazon steered me once again to Samsung.This 29-inch model was a snap to unpack and set up. The stand is sturdy; it's held in place with self-tapping screws. I make sure to cinch down each screw as I proceed; I find this avoids problems down the road.The unit is plug-and-play. Connect it to a power outlet and a cable jack. Power it up, and it goes into an interactive guided process for setting the various parameters, including scanning for available channels.After the plug-and-play process was complete, I tweaked a couple of the settings through the menu to satisfy my preferences for screen brightness and sound quality. As with any LCD TV, sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. But I find this unit is adequate for the location in which I've placed it and the somewhat limited use it will be receiving."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I like it but it was to small for me I thought it was bigger. gave it to my lil girl so she can watch tv on it. nice picture hd
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"purchased for my parents, along with cheetah wall mount.works perfectly with OTA signal, great picture and acceptable sound for a tv this size.for the price, really can't ask for more.  would purchase again."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I needed a TV of this particular size (a larger unit would not have fit in the space I needed it for). After comparing the specs and reviews on the relatively few available 29&#34; TVs, this seemed to be the best of the bunch. The picture quality is excellent and there are ample inputs for my purposes on this TV. I've had zero problems with it so far. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the only audio output available on the unit (with the exception of the built-in speakers) is through a 3.5mm headphone jack on the back of the TV. I would have preferred either optical or coaxial SPDIF with 5.1 channel surround output, but at this price point one can't have everything."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Replaced an old cathode ray tube TV in the kitchen with this one.  Setup was very easy, and the picture is good for a small set.  There is something unusual about the audio, but I cannot put my finger on it, and that does not detract from our enjoyment of the TV."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"The Good:Picture quality is what I expected, though black seemed a hair on the grey side. Colors were good. Vibrant and Bright.Sound Quality was more than acceptable.A lot of people have complained about the stand not being sturdy. I did not have that problem, though getting the screws in correctly could be a little difficult if your screw driver is not magnetic. The slot for them is deep and I couldn't get my fingers in them to get them started.Could be better:Power On time is a little slower than I would like ~10 seconds to get a picture.I don't really like the &#34;joy stick&#34; style control on the back of the TV, it feels awkward to me.Only one HDMI port - Yes I am aware this is listed but they could have put just one more in.All in All:Yeah, I'd buy it again."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Had to get rid of the last analog TV in my house which was a 19&#34; old square one. 4:3 channels are a bit smaller but 16:9 really fills up the screen. I don't need full hi def at this size, neither should you. Small amount of setup was needed to deactivate a sound that indicated turning on and off of the tv (new feature that NO ONE will like). Other than that it's a great Samsung product as usual. Easy to use remote lights up with CC and Sleep 1 button away. Great Bedroom TV."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I haven't checked out anything beyond HDMI input mode. Setup easy and has the right bells and whistles including &#34;Clear Voice&#34;.Attachment of base difficult without a holding Philips driver of the correct size. I had to tighten the three base screws to the point where the drive X felt nearly stripped. Until really tightened, base was floppy and unsuitable.I never could find Samsung model to program DirecTv remote for TV volume, etc. Anyone know how to do it?Very nice picture, sound acceptable for this size TV."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Good picture and easy to set up.  The stand needs to be screwed into the base of the TV to keep it level.  There was a complaint about no off/on switch.  It is on the back.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"It's hard to find a small TV with decent picture quality, and this 19 inch Samsung is about as good as it gets in that respect. I bought it mainly to use while walking on my treadmill, where I'm looking at the screen from a couple of feet back. I'd actually have preferred a 15 or 16 inch TV for this purpose, and I also own a current model, 16 inch Viewsonic that I could have used. But the Samsung's picture is way better; the Viewsonic is washed out by comparison, and if you're not directly in front of the Viewsonic, it gets worse. This seems to be a problem with 15-16 inch TVs in general, based on other reviews on Amazon. Off axis viewing is better, if not ideal, on the 19 inch Samsung. So I can also watch it from across the room when I'm not on my treadmill, as long as the viewing angle isn't too extreme. (Side viewing is better than looking up at it, which makes the picture go dark -- so if you plan to mount the Samsung on wall, get a mount that's easy to tilt).I'm also pleased that the controls and user interface seem logical and straightforward -- though that could be because I own a couple of other Samsung TVs.The sound is about what you'd expect from a TV this size: acceptable, and certainly better than the 15-16 inch models deliver. But most of the time, I'm using the Samsung to watch something off my Roku box, with the sound connected from the Roku to an audio system. The Samsung also offers more in and outs than most small TVs, so there are a variety of connection possibilities.To sum things up: There are a lot of places where a TV this size is the ideal choice, and among the rather few offerings available, this Samsung stands out.On my wish list: I wouldn't have minded paying an extra $50 or so if Samsung had managed to include some ""Smart TV"" features, at least Netflix, Pandora, etc. But it appears Samsung doesn't offer these features on any TV smaller than 32 inches. That's a shame, because if you think about it, the places where you'd want a small TV (kitchens? bathrooms?) are probably the very places where you don't want several pieces of equipment and a tangle of cables. Even though the Roku interface is better than the comparatively sluggish ""Smart TV"" features on one of my larger Samsung sets, I'd have rather not had to dangle the extra cables off my treadmill to connect a Roku box. A smaller TV with Netflix -- and wifi -- would make perfect sense. Are you listening, Samsung? (Vizio makes one, though admittedly, it's 24 inches -- I might have bought it if it were smaller.)"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,The TV started cycling when turned on and would not display a picture. I liked the ability to play avi and .mov files on it so I'm getting a replacement unit and hope this one is not a lemon. Will try and report back in a few months on the replacement unit.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Our house is filled with several years of Samsung TV's.  They are sleek, the picture is crisp and the colors are amazing.  I love digital.  Their price point is very competitive and their products last."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Good: Price, Amazon 2-day shipping, very low power consumption, easy programming, lighted remote, very lightweight, fast volume adjustments.Not so Good: Picture (it is fine for some, but not a fan of LED technology), sound (literally sounds like the cheapest of cheap speakers ever made)Overall: Good purchase. I bought a pair of computer speakers and hooked it up to the 1/8&#34; earphone/audio jack. Problem solved. Since it is a kitchen TV...not too concerned about perfect picture quality. Put a Wattmeter on the outlet to see how much power is being consumed by the TV and speakers...18 watts. Pretty darn good!"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"We got this little TV for the kitchen, and I think it was a great buy. As with all  Samsung TVs, the picture is wonderful, clean, crisp, and colorful. It's also very easy to set up and use. However, the sound isn't so hot. It's tinny and sometimes rather faint. But it is fine for the purpose. And the price couldn't be better.P.S. This TV cannot be used as a computer monitor."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,The picture quality is good and the volume and audio is excellent. What stinks is the stand it comes with. I'm using the stand but have bought a wall mounting bracket.  Whats with the stand?
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This TV is pretty good. It is a 4000 series so it isn't a high end set, but in this size, there is no high end set. The picture is decent and the sound is better than I expected. In all honesty you won't get a better picture in the 19"" size class than this. I had to mark it down because of an issue that most likely not affect many others.That issue is:I used an under cabinet mount to mount this underneath of a top bunk bunk bed. (I am a little nutty) The mounting holes on this set are very high up on the back of the TV. Other sets in this size have the mounting holes at about the middle. Because the mounting holes are so high you can't get the TV very high up on the mount. That really annoys me because it causes the TV to sit a few inches lower than other sets, which in my case takes away from my legroom. I was considering an Insignia which would have worked better, but the picture of the Samsung is superior."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,By far the best picture overall I have ever seen in a small counter top HD LED TV.  Highly recommended.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Bought this from the Amazon Warehouse. It did not look quite like the set pictured. The frame around the screen on the one I received is much thicker than the photo from Amazon. Picture is good, sound is very good and the remote responds great. We use this on a bracket in the kitchen. It sits on the supplied base which was not a problem to set up except Amazon forgot to send the screws to do so. Luckily I had some that worked perfectly. There was some wear on the face of the frame that made it clear that this was not a new TV. Some careful polishing with some compound paste brought it back to looking new. The wear scratches may have been the result of improper repackaging."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I am using this set for my security camera and it does a great job and clear pictures of what is going on outside around my home.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I love this TV.  With limited space and not being a TV addict, this television is fine.  My other set of 30 years had started making electrical short sounds and I needed a good replacement.  The color and clarity are beautiful and I understand that it can have a computer hookup, but have not ventured there at this time."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I received this Samsung 19-inch HDTV yesterday via next day Saturday delivery. It was purchased to replace a small, older portable set in my sunroom, that of which I finally resolved to replace after much hesitation (my motto; if it ain't broke, don't fix it!). I had opted for a Samsung, as my kitchen set is also a Samsung (albeit a costlier 19-inch model HDTV), and I have been very pleased with the performance of that set. Additionally; I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab (tablet), for which there is a ""Peel"" Smart Remote app that allows one to control the channels and volume of any Samsung TV. It also provides detailed program information by category which is very nice to have at your fingertips!The set is very light and easy to set up; 3 screws in the bottom to attach the fixed base, and you're good to go...simply plug the cable into the rear of the set and plug the set into an outlet. Once you turn the TV on, programming instructions will appear; use the fast start guide as a reference. The set will auto-tune your cable provider's channels (I have Verizon FIOS), and you can either manually set the color, contrast, ratio, etc. or utilize the factory preset.As the base is not extendable, I would suggest eye-level placement (the TV has an interesting ""tilt"" feature to compensate for non-eye level placement); I have mine set up on an attractive pedestal (which is actually a plant stand!), and that provides an ideal platform for eye-level viewing.I do wish to add that this particular TV of mine is NOT connected to High Definition broadcasting (I already have 2 HDTV sets that I utilize a bit more often than this one, and am already paying Verizon enough for those set-top boxes and their monthly service in general:), so I maintain a basic ""box"". Nevertheless; I am still very impressed and satisfied with the reception.I am very pleased with this set and consider it a wonderful value for the money."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"my mom wanted a TV in her bedroom. I looked for a few weeks around stores but didn't seem to find the right one. My mom is older and does NOT like new technology because it seems confusing. I cannot blame her way of thinking.The initial setup was all too easy. In fact, the TV does it all for you. Even puts the name of the TV station in the channel selector for you. No more manually entering TV call station identifiers.The picture screen is actually very impressive for 720p. Small and light enough to set on a wooden dresser without fear of imprints on the finish. Very good sound quality. Remote is simple for any age. I highly recommend for the price and quality."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Saw others complaining about the base. Make sure to use the screws provided to connect the base to the TV otherwise it will be extremely wobble-y! I think that's probably what happened to the other owners.Working well so far. Had it 2 weeks. Bought to replace an old CRT TV  with glitchy volume that I had in my room. Sound is much better, and it doubles as a second monitor for my Laptop using http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-Meters/dp/B003L1ZYYM/ref=cm_cr-mr-title to connect. Confusing to use headphones on because it will switch between using the computer speakers and the TV speakers for audio, but can be figured out using trial and error."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I know I could have purchased a cheaper 19"" television set for our kitchen but we have a 46"" Samsung for our main set and love it.  The purchase was also based on third party ratings of small sets.  It was very easy to attach the base and the set was hooked up to an outside antenna which runs though an amplifier.  We are picking up over 30 channels with this set and it was very easy to scan in the channels.Remote was easy to use and similar to the one we have for the larger set.  It has some nice features we were not expecting and we especially like the ""Channel List"" which displays the channels programmed into the set and what show is currently on.Would highly recommend this set for kitchen, dorm, office, etc. where ever there is limited space."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I bought this for one of my work rooms. It sets on a shelf above the work bench. Since the stand is not adjustable, the TV has an option on the menu to choose a ""Lean Back"" setting that adjust the viewing angle so you can get a good picture even viewing from below the TV. It also has a ""Standing"" option.I'm just hooked up to a cable so I can't comment on any of the other input features.Cons:I do wish it had a ""Favorites"" button on the remote to let you advance through your favorite channels. To view your favorite channels you have to go through menu options each time.There is supposed to be an option for the TV to adjust the brightness automatically based on the light in the room but for some reason I can't activate that feature. The option is gray, non-selectable."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Yes, all previous reviews are true. Nothing wrong with this tv except the cheap stand that's very difficult to put on."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This TV is OK. Good sound. But the color is just kind of off and I can't get it to look great after lots of adjustments.Also, there is NO AUDIO INPUT which was a giant disappointment"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This TV fit the space for a it in our new 5th wheel trailer, have not used very much yet but it has a great picture and the sound is good. looking forward to enjoying in the very near future."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,the stand that comes with the tv is a cheap plastic and it hard to connect to the tv.  nice little tv though but due to the stand I give this a two star because the stand is a pretty important part
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I got this to replace my old 12&#34; tv for my kitchen counter.  I chose Samsung since we had purchased a 42&#34; one for our living room 3 years ago and were very satisfied with that purchase.  This tv is a nice size, perfect for the space I keep the kitchen tv in.  My only complaint is that the sound is very &#34;tinny&#34;.  I plan to look and see if there is a place to hook up a pair of small speakers to to help fix that problem.  Other than that I am happy with the purchase."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"I got this for the headphone jack, but I really don't like the TV. It has no real cord. The cord has a somewhat bulky detachable AC adapter, which I don't like. The TV is too short like many LED TV's and not easily tilted downward toward my bed. Base is too small. Doesn't seem slim. Reception poor. The red light is on the right bottom side and not the center. I would never buy any Samsung TV for my bedroom ever again, unless it was the only headphone jack TV on the market."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"When the ancient CRT based TV in our guest room expired I was looking for a good replacement.I checked locally and no one had a good name brand smaller LED / LCD TV.  There were a few off brand models, or I could order one at a local store.This TV was at a really good price point for a Samsung.  Not much more to say.  Worked great out of the box.  Setup was very easy.Picture quality is excellent.  Sound quality is good enough for its intended purpose.  Can't say about the HDMI inputs as we don't need those at this time.I would recommend this TV if you need a smaller format model."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,Nice tv for nice price.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This was purchased for a small off fits perfect great sound clear picture, remote is clear and to the point colors are perfect no complaints...."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Great for being able to watch some Netflix in bed. Picture isn't the best, but it's not as bad as I've seen on other inexpensive TVs. Some decent settings to adjust the brightness, color, etc... Sound is pretty good. Overall it's an great, inexpensive small TV. Don't expect it to blow you away with cinema-quality performance."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This is quite a nice TV. It replaces my trusty Sony stereo 13&#34;. My monthly electric bill has gone down by $35 due to this replacement. It was a good move and this is a truly beautiful picture with nice stereo sound. I have cable TV and the 720P works great. 1080P might be nicer on paper, but with TVs of this size there would probably be little improvement. Sports will be fine with at 60HZ. March madness was beautiful.I have read reports of unsteady stands. You just have to tighten the screws down until they won't turn any more. Pretend that they are self tapping screws and everything will be fine. I would buy another one and if I get to the place where a larger TV would be needed I will buy another Samsung."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"Great picture, price and TV. Very light and perfect for a wall mounted TV in a limited space area. Ours is in the kitchen."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"For general home use, as we do in the kitchen, this TV provides a decent-enough picture and adequate sound for the casual or passive viewing and listening experience that it is being used for.  It is very economical to operate considering its 12-volt DC power supply.  It is very compact for use on the kitchen counter and below cabinets.  However, the only negative is that with the need to use the power adapter, plus make cable connections from the source to a digital box and then to the TV, there's a lot of cables and wiring to try and conceal when sitting on a relatively-open kitchen cabinet.  A more simplified or condensed power supply with less cords/wires would be more appealing."
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"There aren't many major brand Flat Panel TVs that will fit under the upper cabinet in your kitchen. We have 2 other Samsung TV's in the house and are very happy with them.  It was a nice surprise to find this model for our kitchen.  Its also nice to have the same remote control design in 3 rooms.  The picture is great and the sound is pretty good for the small speakers facing down from the bottom edge.A year ago we bought a 22"" Visio for the kitchen.  It fit because it has no stand to increase its height.  The sound on the 22"" Vizio was poor . . often hard to understand speech on some programs with the Vizio.The TV is very light weight.  To allow the TV to turn on the granite counter, I removed the sticky rubber feet and put on felt pads available at hardware stores for chair feet. The felt pads are very slippery so you can spin the TV with a finger tip.Two Minor shortcomings for our needs:1. TV has only 1 HDMI input. Our primary program source is HDMI, but with Amazon-Prime and NetFlix subscriptions we also ordered a RoKu3 module to play Amazon/NetFlix programming to this TV. It would be nice not to have to use an external HDMI switch.  (We just discovered RoKu - its the competitor to the Apple TV module, but usually considered better than Apple TV unless most of your other gadgets are also Apple)2. This TV has an external power block like your notebook computer.  On our Peninsula kitchen counter, we turn this TV to face the Kitchen or Dinette. It would be nice to not have this power block to hide.  Being compulsive about tidy electronics installations, I lengthened the low voltage power wire on the power block and placed it in the unfinished basement below the TV. Now we only have the thin black low-voltage power wire going into a wall plate along with the HDMI feed from the basement. The DishTV and Roku remote controls are both Radio-Frequency so the DishTV HDMI-module and RokU-Module can be in the basement below the TV.Overall, we are really happy to find this great TV that is only 12.5"" tall with the stand.  If you really need 2 HDMI inputs and are OK with the higher price, look at the 19"" Toshiba TVToshiba 19L4200U 19-Inch 720p 60Hz LED TV (Black)"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,"This t.v. went into a spare bedroom, the picture is so clear and the sound is great.  I like Samsung products,,"
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,I was excited to get this Samsung at such a low price. Picture quality is top notch and speaker volume is more than plenty. We are using it in the kitchen and can see it from all angles to no need to rotate the TV horizontally or vertically to get a clear picture.  Definitely a great buy.
Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch 720p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV,For a small TV it really surprised me.  The picture is great and it meets all my expectations.  This is my first HD TV I have purchased for my home.  With a special box from Charter it even gives me the channels that are scrambled by Charter unless their box is attached.  It was a  very easy setup and all instructions were clearly spelled out.  I recommend this purchase.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This product is perfect for plane rides. It doesn't completely remove the engine noise, but it puts it so far into the background that you won't even notice it. And there's very little chance you'll actually be able to hear people talk around you.For every day use, I'd pick up some other headphones. The only reason to buy these is for the noise cancellation. Unless you live next to the highway, you should use other headphones with better sound quality."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I already own a pair of Bose Around ear headphones(AE2) and wanted to give this a try.These headphones beat my expectations. They are very comfortable to wear,sound the best i heard till date and most of all, the noise cancelling is awesome.These take just one AAA battery as opposed two by Beats and Souls..and the battery life is amazing. Overall these headphones are worth their price and are the best you can get in this price range. Get this one and you wont be disappointed!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've had this headphone for over a year now. I've used if for everything from intense gaming to audiophiling to drowning out  some annoying sounds. I have only a couple complaints. Considering the fact that the QC15 is $300, the quality and build of this headphone feels a bit plasticy. Because of this, It is a tiny bit fragile. The headphone itself will wear down over time. My second complaint is that when the battery is low, the ear phones turn on and off WHENEVER you move or touch the headphones making an annoying click sound. Other than that, The Bose QC 15 is a great headphone. Remember, the QC 15 was designed mainly for travel so these are at its best on an airplane. In fact, these are so good that airlines let people use QC15s during flight in 1st class. These are superb at blocking out low end sounds but are not as good for high end sounds such as high voices. Paired with some music, the QC15 can be one of those headphones where people get pissed at you because you can't hear them and they think you are ignoring them. The audio quality is a little bit above standard but not amazing. The bass is a tad bit... dry. BUT, for gaming, the QC15 is amazing not because of its sound quality but because of its noise cancellation. With Skyrim on full blast and Noise cancellation turned on, I doubt I could hear a jet engine 2 feet away from my ears! The QC15 is the ultimate immersion headphone when gaming. No distractions, no background noise, just you and your game. Overall, for $300 bucks, this headphone is pretty good!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are amazing.Blocks out almost all the ambient noises on airplane...especially the loud vibrations of the engines. Make your plane ride much more relaxing.It would be nice if it could also block out other people's conversations. You are still able to hear people around you talking, but that doesn't bother me too much."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these to wear on airplane trips and such, where they do wonders to drown out engine sounds, and other things that generate low frequency noises. I also find myself wearing them to the grocery store, and other noisy places, just because I like listening to music more than screaming kids :)The one thing I DON'T like is the on/off switch. I wish it were a soft button that auto turned itself off after a few minutes of no audio. As it stands, I forget to turn these off a lot, so when I go to use them again, the battery is dead :P"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bose has earned its title.  Excellent noise cancelling effect.  At the same price, I feel it better than Monster dr. dre studio."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these headphones 2 years ago. I use them every day - virtually everywhere I go.  I am a long-time drummer and at age 58, still gig on a regular basis. Through the years I have owned and tried a ton of headphones by many manufacturers. Many great brands are available in ALL price ranges. Sennheiser, Audio Technica, Sony just to name  few.Why did I buy these?Well...I am very careful about wearing ear plugs while drumming - to protect myself from hearing loss. Because of this, I thought that the noise canceling feature would allow me to enjoy my music without turning them up loud to drown out background  distractions. This choice paid off...in MOST situations. Overall, they work very well - sound reproduction is very good - from classical, jazz, rock and roll to hip hop to r&b.; For most people, they will serve them well.Are there better buys and headphones out there? Yes...but considering the overall performance (and COMFORT), they are a good choice for most people. Would I recommend to friends? YES!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I never understood what the big whoop was about noise cancelling headphones.  But when I saw everyone on planes in first class using them-AND some planes offering them on select flights I had to check out WHY.  for one, if you travel, as I do, I have found one of the most exhausting things is the constant sound of the plane.  the headphones cut way down on that right off the bat.  plus those hideous little freebies (or 2 dollar) headphones on planes dont do anything to cut down on noise  with the BOSE--you plug in and instantly cut down on the noise even if you are not listening to anything at all. and when you do listen to something--the noise of the plane is gone and the sound of the movies or music is fantastic.  I do wish the cord was a bit more substantial and i have unplugged them from the headphones themselves by accident (with my foot) so you have to be a little careful with them. but at this price you would treat them gently anyway.  Nice and light compared to &#34;professional&#34; headphones which tend to give me an ear ache after a while.  I now never ever travel without these.  worth every penny to me."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I've had these for about a month and the comfort of these headphones on my ears and the noise cancellation is what made me keep these. The sound is very good and I know that other headphones have better sound but these things are pillows on my ears and it sounds very good and the noise cancellation is really that good. I have a hard time hearing anything even when my wife is speaking directly towards me with the Bose QC 15 on. I actually just returned a warehouse deal on V-Moda 100's ($251) because of the headphones being too tight fitting around my ears but they sounded great and the volume of these where the highest with a iPhone (it was skull jarring).  I have a pair of Beats Studios currently which are great if you want very loud bass heavy and I use it mainly for my Xbox because of the boom of gunshots and explosions. I prefer the Bose for long periods of music listening and my long flights from Hawaii. You will like these especially for the price now.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had this one and Audio Technica M50 at the same time. First time, I heard both of these. It was 50% that I would return Bose. After two weeks, Bose went back to the store. The sound of M50 is much tighter, cleaner. Both mid range vocal and trebles were smoother. I enjoyed all kind of music with M50. Bose have more base but not deep and precise like M50. I give 2 stars for this because of comfort when wearing it. Bose is lighter and fit better on me. But the sound quality still won. I decided to return QC15 NOT because of the price. I would do the same even for same price as M50...I know many people still like QC15 but try M50 also before make your decision."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Like many others, I make fun of Bose on a regular basis for being ""all marketing rather than product"".  And many of their car systems truly deserve a well earned raspberry.  These, however, are touted as being really good at one thing and that's noise cancellation while traveling.  Any given commercial flight today will have at least one person wearing a set of these more than likely and there's a great reason for that.  They just flat out work.  There's a lot of stuff I don't want to hear while flying: engine noise, wind noise, flight attendants, pilots, screaming babies, the annoying lady sitting next to me, etc.  Put these on, voila.  Problem solved, all those annoying noises go away or are at least greatly attenuated.  I've heard better sounding headphones but the QC15s are super comfortable for me, provide excellent noise cancellation and make flying a much more pleasant experience IMHO.  Along with a good carrying case and the ability for the first year at least to replace at any Bose store, they're one of my essential travel tools.  It really is true for me - I arrive much less frazzled with these now.  Expensive but if you want the best noise cancellation units at a semi-reasonable price currently?"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Been through 4 of them. It is always one side that will quit working or you get intermittent signal on one side. See other reviews. Great product for noise cancel and comfort but they must use very thin cables between each side. I will say the warranty has been honored each time at a cost of $80 exchange each time. Quality is TERRIBLE.And I do not abuse the headphones in any manner other that normal use. I take care of products I purchase.My headphone list includes:And not one has broken yet I've gone through 4 Bose QC15 in 3 years:Grado SR-60, Grado SR-80, Sennheisers HD555, HD595, HD600, HD650, ATM-50S, Ultrasone HFI-780, AKG 701Q.All are mint condition including the SR-60 which I have had for 7 plus years."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,What can one say - these are the gold standard.  Pricey and somewhat bulky - but you won't hear someone sitting next to you!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"What I like:-The best active noise-cancelling, period. I would describe the sensation more as being in a vacuum then having pressure on the ears-The most comfortable around the ear headphones I have ever used due to light weight, light clamping pressure, nice headband cushioning, and plush earpads-Plastic construction makes it light, and therefore comfortable-User replaceable earpads-Detachable audio cable with low/high switch to control volume-Decent audio performanceWhat I don't like:-Bass is one-tone and highs are sometimes shrill to the point of hurting my earsSound and comfort when compared to Klipsch Image One, Harman Kardon CL, B&W; P5, Logitech UE6000, Sennheiser Momentum:-Klipsch Image One is too bass-heavy. Comfort is merely OK because the cushions are so small they straddle the line between circum-aural and on-ear-Harman Kardon CL has solid but not overwhelming bass and clear mids and highs. Unique headband mechanism is comfortable for half an hour but becomes uncomfortable if worn for longer periods-B&W; P5: Although this was by far the best-looking out of all the headphones, I found it to have a somewhat hollow sound especially when compared to the Harman Kardon CL. A very tight (and unadjustable) clamping force made listening very uncomfortable even for brief periods. That, plus the questionable durability (just go into any apple store and see how beat up the leather pads get over time), made me feel this was overpriced at $300-Logitech UE6000 will have more prominent bass with active noise cancellation function turned on with better clarity in the mids and highs with noise cancellation turned off. It is very comfortable (not as much as QC15). Users may notice an audible ""hiss"" due to the noise cancellation-Sennheiser Momentum has crisp but not shrill highs and a nice bass. Comfort is close to the QC15 as long as your ears fit into the plush cushions, and overall weight is a barely-there 190gFor sound quality I would rank Sennheiser Momentum>Logitech UE6000=Harman Kardon CL>B&W; P5>Klipsch One=Bose QC15For comfort Bose QC15>Sennheiser Momentum>Logitech UE6000>>Harman Kardon CL=Klipsch One=B&W; P5For noise isolation Bose QC15>>Logitech UE6000 (active mode)>Harman Kardon CL>Sennheiser Momentum>B&W; P5=Klipsch OneGet QC15 if you're a frequent traveler who wants to drown out all noise. Looks elsewhere if you're an audiophile."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"As a frequent flyer, I'm on the road a lot. I also make a good amount of trips overseas. Previously, I put earplugs in and set the volume of the provided headsets as high as possible so I could somewhat understand what was being said in the movies. Once I received this birthday present, I couldn't believe the difference it made in traveling. Not only am I able to hear everything crystal clear, it is so comfortable over my ears that I have no problems keeping it on for 10 hours straight. The 1 AAA battery lasts me a week or more of heavy use.The sound quality it provides is exellent and cables and extension pieces are provided to fit 1-pin and 2-pin connectors for planes. I cannot come up with anything negative to say about this product. Also, from what I've heard of friends of mine is that the customer service of Bose is outstanding.Awesome product!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Absolutely wonderful on planes. Listening to music or watching movies on iPad and iPhone. Of course would be just as good anywhere you want to cancel out noise, even if you don't listen to anything else.Always remember to store with the battery removed. I have experienced many AA cells leaking lately."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I work in an office environment where the powers that be put us into something called a pod where they put four people in the pod.  The theory is that it is to improve team collaboration.  The truth is that we do collaborate more, but that there are far too many disruptions that just aren't necessary, because it is still way too easy to be distracted and pulled into random conversations.  We all owned our own headphones, my own were some highly rated Sennheisers.  I thought that they did a pretty good job at isolating me from the random office chatter, but I was wrong.  My boss just bought all of us these Bose QC15 headphones and I can tell you that I now get hours of uninterrupted concentration per day now, when before it was probably never more than 30 minutes.I've tried noise canceling headphones before, but nothing has performed like this.  They always had a bit of an annoying hiss and also didn't really cut out much more than continuous noise, like an airplane engine.  These do a MUCH better job.  There is no noticeable hiss and although I can still here voices here and there, they are much more muffled and much less distracting.Well done, Bose.  I always thought you were a gimmick company suckering people to pay too much, but these things are pretty amazing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Great headphones, sounds quality is more than adequate, and noise cancellation is fantastic.  Although, there are plenty of reviews that address sound quality and noise cancellation, so I'll leave it at that.I simply want to acknowledge that the phone controls do NOT work with Android phones.  I've tried it with my Samsung Galaxy S Captivate and the phone is completely unresponsive to these buttons, but the inline mic does work.That's a pretty weak showing on Bose's part! How can Bose put so much effort into quality head phones and completely over 40% of mobile phone users??"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If you were sold by the ads touting the QuietComfort 15 as giving you a ""concert hall"" in your head while flying, you'll be disappointed. The active noise cancellation dampens engine noise modestly. It also works for HVAC systems and other mechanical vibrations. It does nothing for the sounds that actually make flying unbearable: crying babies, obnoxious yelling, incessant in-flight announcements.Still, it's enough. With the QC 15, you can watch a movie or listen to a podcast without cranking up the volume to ear-damaging levels. That's wonderful. They're also really, truly comfortable, more than any other headphones I've tried: very light, with large padded cups that fit around your ears rather than putting pressure on them. I can wear these for hours without feeling any neck strain or pinching. I could fall asleep with these on. That's remarkable.In travel, these are an unrivaled luxury. Elsewhere, though, they're lackluster. I wish they could be used without the active noise cancellation, which feels slightly weird when it's not needed and quickly devours AAA batteries. Until Bose solves that problem, I feel like I need a separate pair of headphones to wear at home.Oh, as to the confusingly named QC 3: They're slightly more portable, but have lower audio quality (according to a Bose employee I spoke to), use a proprietary battery that has to be replaced or recharged more often, and cost $50 more. So, I would definitely choose the QC 15."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I get this mainly for its' wonderful noise cancelling capability. It help me to concentrate in the office while working in a noisy environment. I also fly long haul quite often and this has been a savior for me as it help me so that I can have a proper rest on the plane without the hissing engine sound. However if you are looking for sound quality, get a Sennheiser HD600/650 or HD800 with a proper DAC & amp. They are built for Sound Quality while this Bose QC15 are built for noise cancelling headphone.Another thing, I've had ATH-ANC7b for 3 years now and I'd say that the $250 difference is worth it. ANC7b is much bigger (both the cans & the cases) and also lose in terms of noise cancelling capabilities. Sound quality is also inferior. I'm currently looking to sell my ANC7b now as I'm happy with this pair of can.Again, the conclusion is if you want to get the best NC headphone around, this is the one, but if you are looking for SQ, get a Sennheiser HD600/650/800."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It's been a long journey, I've purchased, tried and returned many headphones, thinking there was a way to avoid paying the Bose price.  But at the end of the day, these headphones are just so much better than anything in their class!Comfort - I've worn them for hours at a time, in my wood shop, on airplanes, in my office or just trying to grab a little peace and quiet in the easy chair. They're so light and comfortable.Fidelity - I believe I have a pretty discerning ear and can testify these phones are more than worthy for any music.  They're not heavy in any particular range and provide an accurate and balanced frequency response.  I use them on my iPhone, iPad and home entertainment equipment, no complaints.  If you're partial to boosting a particular frequency range, just dial up your equalizer.Noise Cancelation - Let's face it folks, Bose wrote the book on active noise cancelation.  They simply work far better than anything out there that I've tested.  Couple this technology with the passive isolation of the oh so comfortable, headphone pads and head set design and it's just you and your programing.The iPhone microphone and function switches work as advertised.  I only wish these headphones were wireless, but I guess you just can't have everything.  Bottom line, if you're looking for the best darn noise canceling earphones ever made, buy these, you won't be disappointed."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have owned three different NC headphones and these are the gold standard. At home, in the car or on a plane."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are well-adapted for use on planes & trains --- good acoustic isolation, very good noise cancellation, cord on one side only, and reasonably compact. Sound quality is not the primary concern for these situations.But in normal use, sound quality is their downfall. Quite different from the audiophile sound Bose hypes, they are heavily tweaked, mid-range-weak, unnatural sound, perhaps good for heavily amped rock music but pretty poor for classical, or indeed any unzapped acoustic, music.Another annoyance is that the headphones have no passive mode. They ONLY work with the noise cancellation switched on.I feel like I've paid for Bose's marketing, not for good headphones.(Note: I bought these from Amazon but do not show up as a confirmed buyer because I'd bought the ""special edition"" ones, identical except for the color)."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought a decent, lower-priced set of sound-cancelling earphones by another manufacturer a few years ago. What a waste! The sound quality of these Bose earphones is truly amazing. If you listen to serious music, aka ""classical,"" please don't waste your money on other products. This is as close as it gets to being there. I'm hearing things I just assumed one could not hear outside of the concert hall. I am so glad I finally bought these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these as a gift for a co-worker.  I had had mine for about 1 year and he always inquired about them when we traveled together.  I have been extremely satisfied with the performance of these headphones.  They are an awesome item and long flight or even short ones.  They isolate you quite well from cabin noise as well as other passengers.  My only complaints are size and occasional performance issues.Size:These things are quite big.  In the day in age of being nickled and dimed during any travel experience for bag fees and neary fist fighting for overhead bin space, size matters.  The included soft sided case is quite nice but again size is an issue.  I find them difficult to fit into my bag at times but their benefits far out weight the minor annoyance of finding a place to cram them into.Performance Issues:Occasionally a fellow traveler seems to have a natural voice frequency that simpler cannot be &#34;noise-canceled&#34; by these things.  I was on a long flight from LA to ORD and felt like Fran Drescher was seated behind me and was further appalled when I determined my headphones could not cancel out her bone cutting voice.Overall worth every stinking penny!!!  You will wonder how you traveled without them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Works great, more comfortable than their other options in my oppion. cheaper and more comfortable = home run. will probably buy another pair eventually (my old pair 5 years old are still working flawlessly)."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The sound is good, and the headphone is really comfortable. BUT:- You cant use it with the noise cancelling off, so you will ALWAYS be dependent on battery.- It doesnt has a auto-off after no use time for the noice cancelling, so when you forget it on, good bye battery.- Not surround 5.1 or 7.1.- Noise cancelling is nothing special... It works for airconditioning sound, and plane sound.Buy it if you like comfortable headphones with a good sound quality. But, in my opinion, it doesnt worth the 300 dollars."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had been considering the Q15s or the Beats by Dre Studio headphones for awhile. I would test them in the stores and ask my friends and it was a pretty even split between the two. The Beats seem a bit heavier on the bass but the Bose are crisper on everything else. Deep lows, fantastic surround sound, good noise canceling, and sexy design make these headphones well worth the price. I was on the plane and was awoken by a crying baby, put these bad boys on and went right back to sleep in peace and quiet. The noise canceling seem to cancel out consistent lower tones. People talking loudly or alarms or other high pitched loud noises can be heard, but are greatly reduced in sound, to the point where you can ignore it and burn down with a house on fire. My biggest beef is that the iPod/iphone connection is cool but you can't change songs with it, just pause and volume. It is a great buy though."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm really, really pleased with these. I got them to make long airplane flights more bearable, and they do that very well! They make the bad sounds go away, far away. They are big enough to cover your ears, but smaller and lighter than I had imagined they would be.  Comfortable enough and light enough to wear for very extended periods.  The noise cancellation works very well and produced no irritating effects that I was aware of.  I read in some other reviews that the sound reproduction is not &#34;audiophile&#34; quality.  That may be.. I have some nice Shure earbuds that are much brighter than these.. but these have a most pleasing quality to them, a fullness and a robust bass and maybe a little off the top end, that makes them so easy to listen to for long periods of time.  I used them on two flights of 12 hours each.  They didn't hurt my ears, they didn't become tiresome to listen to, and they didn't wear down, in fact all 24 hours were on ONE battery!  The compact hard-shell travel case is very nice to have, and has room to hold spare batteries and an adapter or two.  The only improvement I can imagine would be some kind of sensor to detect when they are not in use and turn off the power.  You have to remember to manually switch it off when you put them away, or you will run down the battery.  However, that's a minor complaint; they do have a little LED that indicates power on, it's facing you when you put them away, and you just have to remember to flip the switch and power down before you close the case.  I'm very happy with my purchase, and would highly recommend them to others."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I suppose there is something even more amazing out there and that even Bose makes it. But at this price point, it is 1. a sanity saver and 2. Nice quality sound. The hard part is remembering to turn them off when not in use. If I remember to turn them off, I can use them on long flights and for a LONG time. If I just leave them turned on for 24 hours straight, well, one teensy battery doesn't make it. But the fact they run on one teensy, easily transportable, readily found battery makes them light and convenient. (AAA). They are worth the space in the carry on, and few things are."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones was exactly what i was looking for. it does cancel out all background noice, exept my wife. i actually dont need music when im out flying, but i can hear much better what people are saying. dont like that they dont work at all witout battery doh."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I really enjoy these although they are pricey.  I use them in a communications environment.  The noise cancelling works very well.  I wish someone would come up with some headphones that could be powered via the audio cable.  I end up going through a lot of batteries.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I used this headphone over a transatlantic flight, 13+ hours one way. The noise canceling is simply amazing. When you put it on, it basically cancel all the ambient noise, except a little. This is simply amazing. As far as I am aware, this is the best noise canceling headphone out there.1. Sound quality is good. Not enough bass but it is probably acceptable since its primary use is noise canceling.2. During flight, you will have to put the volume to 40% to hear clear sound of TV or audio program. To listen to the same video on aeroplane provided headphone, you to listen at 90% of volume. But the 40% volume of boss is *much* clear and *much* enjoyable than than 90% volume by regular headphone.3. Sometime the pilot will interrupt and make an announcement. This can be extremely loud on this headphone, almost deafening. I did not have problem with it going back (may there were not such announcement or they were on normal volume) but on my way back, it was terrible to hear those announcement on this headphone.4.They are pretty comfortable on air for long flight. I did felt quite pressurized when I wore it for a while but I know that is not headphone fault. It is just that our ears are not used to have something on it for a long period of time.5. The biggest draw back of this headphone is, when the battery runs out, it is garbage. Yes, it is completely garbage. It will not work as regular headphone (without noise canceling headphone).So I do appreciate the headphone with it superb noise canceling quality, it is truly a remarkable product. But the fact that it does not work without batteries is a serious disadvantage and rather expensive if you look at that.My personnel opinion is, this is not a necessary. We human pretty much get used our environment what ever it is, even if it a bit noise in the plane. I have been some extremely loud aeroplanes, in that case it will be a boon. Listening to TV shows become far more enjoyable with this headphone. I would consider it as luxury item."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The Good- Best overall headphone experience I've ever had, and that's saying a lot I have many sets of headphones.- You get what you pay for here.- Great Noise Cancelation, totally blocks out annoying hums, airplane noise or crowd noise. Don't worry you'll still be able to hear people trying to get your attention.- Build quality is excellent, just what you'd expect from Bose.- Sound quality is excellent.- Hands down the most comfortable headphones I've ever tried on. I have worn these for hours without the slightest discomfort.- The head band is positioned more forward than most headphones so that you can wear them laying down with your head on a pillow if you have to.- Noise cancelation works even with cable unplugged. Keep in mind they do have to be turned on and it will still drain the battery.- Includes a very nice case that is much more low profile than I expected.- I've Used the heck out of these and I'm still on the original battery that came with them. I think battery life is around 30 hours.My Criticisms- It does take 1 aaa battery. Carry an extra battery or two if your traveling, because if the battery dies they don't work at all. Battery life is great.- If you accidentally leave them on it will drain the battery. Thankfully there is an on indicator light that has saves me from leaving them on several times.- Eventually you get used to switching them off as you take them off your head, so this is not much of an issue.Bottom LineThe Bose Quiet Comfort 15's are solidly built, sound great, look great, Noise cancellation works better than anything else on the market, They include a nice case, you really can't go wrong with these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am not a huge Bose fan.  I often think there products are average and overpriced.  I am getting ready for a trip to Europe and need a very good set of headphones with noise cancellation.  After countless research on product review and speaking with several friends, I decided to give Bose another try.  Overall, I was very impressed with these headsets.  It comes nicely packaged with a very durable carrying case.  On a scale of 10, I would rate the quality of the headsets at 10.  They are very well made - better than I expected.  The headsets fit perfectly and very soft and light - should be no problem for a long trip.  The noise cancellation feature seems to work great.  It battery powered, but it works.  So far, I am very happy with my purchase."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If Bose could package this noise cancelling technology in a headphone that was actually well constructed (example: the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x), I'd be in heaven.  The headphones are sort of dorky looking, and plasticy... The sound quality is pretty decent (nothing near the ATH-M50x, but decent). I'm just not impressed at all with the build on these. Even the audio cable is flimsey and cheap... But damn their noise cancelling technology is good. If that's what you really want, then these may be the ticket.With that said, these put enough pressure on your eardrums to be noticeable.  I was able to deal with it, but my GF wasn't... So be warned, these aren't for everyone."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I want to focus this review on what the main purpose of these headphones is ... to cancel out unwanted background noise, especially when flying.  I've owned a pair of Sony NC phones prior to this and they did a good job.  This pair of headphones does an EXCELLENT job.  I fly a lot (weekly) and having this little respite from the noise of the flight is a pleasure.  My advice is to take Bose up on their 30 day money back guarantee and try them.  The background quiets down a little when you put them on and when you hit the power switch, it's like walking into a quiet room.  Does the noise go away completely?  Of course not.  Does the noise level drop like a rock?  You bet.  These headphones do what they were designed to do.Just a comment on sound quality.  Is the sound reproduction as good as my $500 Sennheisers?  Of course not.  But it is very good on this Bose pair and also, if I were to use the Sennheisers on an airplane, I'm pretty sure the perceived sound reproduction would not be perfect either.  These headphones are intended to balance noise cancelling with sound quality and they do this very well.The only downside is battery usage but it's more of an inconvenience than a cost issue.  The headset uses inexpensive AAA batteries but life (as stated by Bose support) is about 24 hours.  I'm guessing less, like about 15 to 20.  These headphones won't let you listen to music if the battery is dead like my Sony phones did, so I suggest putting a spare or two in the pocket of the included hard shell carry pouch."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel a lot and wouldn't dream of leaving without my Bose headsets. The only issue I have is that you cannot listen to them without them turned on. If you do purchase them, do yourself a favor and carry an extra battery in the carrying case, you'll be glad you did."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Why I should have given the money to Church instead:- Average sound quality and lesser base(non too essential unless that's what you care)- Not made to last and so is the leather muffle.- Wire connection for to headphone and device will losen overtime so does the quality of sound taken factor.- Short battery life(not an issue if you use rechargable. Recommand Rayvac from Target great battery and cheap)- No improvement since QC2- Hit and run customer service. Only option for customer is pay 100-150 USD to replace a new. Yes you do have to quite stright and rude. Screaming their ears off and no compomise. (had to replace my QC2 quit for no reason)- Over rated price which took totally different ideal from their original founder. Initial founder believe in fair price and quality sound for all.- One good of all sad faces. Light I often forget I had them on. Where is my glasses? (oh it's on my head)- I will give it as a good ear warmer during winter time too.I am not a professional sound track personal. However I will not dull myself due to paying expensive price then believe I own the best. I firmly believe even Royce has it's down falls.Some say Stax are fine set. I did not earn it yet so that's up to you to find out.Choices are naturally up to you. But I hope I could at least shead some pre buy knowledge to you. I personally dont want to give company such as Bose a chance to survive. Take a good thought why do you love Amazon. Whereas Bose has become rodent of society.From customer that demands uncompromised quality,Work hard and be willing to pay/support to whom deserves,Ted"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I used to own the $300.00 Beat by Dre.  I thought those were amazing, they broke and my friend said he will never use anything but Bose.  I decided it was my turn.  Not a fan of putting batteries in headphones but with the phenomenal noise cancellation and the clearness of the music I will always own these.  I can hear my self think"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought the Bose QuietComfort 15 Noise Cancelling Headphones about a month ago and am thoroughly impressed thus far.Sound Quality: As odd as this may sound, I feel like I haven't ever listened to any of my songs! This headset completely revamps every song. You will hear things in some of your favorite songs you haven't heard before. As it says in the title, this is an acoustic headset so don't expect loud and powerful base. If you like a lot of base then this isn't the headset for you.Noise Cancelling: I find that I can still hear people talking while I am on a plane but most of the background noise goes away. I would describe the sound as if you are underwater or plugging your ears, to give you an idea of the sound. When you play some light music in the background, all the people talking tend to dissappear. I take up anywhere from 50 to 100 flights in a year and now that I own a Bose headset, I couldn't imagine not having it with me.Comfort: The headset is extremely comfortable with leather around the ear and the leather on the top of the headset. This makes it very comfortable for long periods of time. I used to use ear buds and found that my ears started to hurt after 30 minutes. The only thing I will mention is that your ears do get a bit hot a sweaty after a while so it is good to give them a breath of fresh air every hour or so.Carrying Case: In this box comes with a carrying case to help protect your Bose headset. This was a huge selling feature for me because with all the travelling I do, I was worried about ruining my headset. This allows me to put the case in my bag and not have to worry that I am crushing it. Great addition Bose!Cord: Although this headset isn't wireless, it has a detachable cord which I find very useful. If you don't want to listen to anything, don't attach the cord and you can relax with noise cancelling feature. If you do want to listen to music or watch a movie, attach the cord. Easy.Batteries: The headset runs on (1) AAA battery which fits right into a nice location on the headset. I keep an extra AAA battery in my carrying case just in case it dies while I am travelling. I haven't had to replace the battery yet and I have used it for quite a few flights. I am very impressed with how long it lasts!Airplane connector: Bose also included an airplane connector which some airlines still use. I haven't come across a time I have had to use this but it certainly is nice to have if I need it.Downfalls: There isn't much I would change about the Bose QC 15 but the most important one would be that I can't listen to music if my battery is dead. Again this hasn't happened to me but if my battery were to die, I can't listen to music. You have to have the noise cancelling feature on to listen to anything. Other than that, there is nothing I would change.Price: This headset is quite pricey so it isn't meant for the average person. There are other headsets that I would recommend. But if you are the type of person who travels a lot of find yourself in locations where the noise bothers you (ie train, bus, etc), this is the headset for you.Well done Bose, you have turned my into a believer and I couldn't imagine travelling without my Quiet Comfort 15!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"So I'm not one to spend $300 on a set of headphones, and I didn't, 6 of my friends did collectively on VenTribe.comBut I've since bought my dad them, because you get what you pay for. I'll keep this short and sweet:- Unreal sound quality (better than any headphones I've ever used)- Really comfortable - they look quite big but sit nicely- Noise cancelling really does mean exactly that unlike a lot of cheaper alternatives.And with the switch of a button, you can switch from music to using your phone.I love them"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Just not what I expected. I do a bit of airline travel and have almost always used a CD player (before iPods) or an iPod. Have used earbuds-only but was not pleased with all the additional noise. Picked up a pair of noise cancelling headphones a fellow employee had left behind about 10 years ago....and used them for several years. I don't know who the manufacturer was for those but they were/are adequate but the ear pieces fit on the ear rather than over and around. Not the most comfortable. Have always thought about getting the Bose. First, they are very comfortable. No problems wearing them on a 4 hour flight. With the caveat that I am older AND that I have a hearing impairment from a viral infection a few years ago, I was not at all happy with the quality of the sound on the Bose headphones. (It's a given that, as you age, you slowly lose your ability to hear high pitch.) The Bose were simply far too bass-ey for my taste. I've gone back to the older set which -- for me -- sound much better. Seems for the price, Bose could incorporate an in-line equalizer. (I have an idea that many people would find that the Bose are not bass-ey enough.) With an equalizer, everyone could choose their own 'mix'. A real plus -- which I had only experienced with a couple of early-model Kindles -- is the great return policy and method of Amazon. Quick, easy and the money is returned very quickly. However, even so, I would encourage others to do what I did not do: find a pair to 'test' before you actually spring for the purchase."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is the first time and hopefully the last that I spend $300 on a pair of headphones, but let me tell you if you're going on a long international flight it is well worth it.  It is amazing how much background noise gets eliminated by the noise cancellation, and the sound of the headphones is a perfect balance of treble and bass.  Not too much bass, like other headphones but just the right amount."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are lite, fit over my ears, and the insides of the cans don't touch, or press against my ears as some headphones do. The noise cancelling is good, but not the strongest I've had. They seem to be better at cancelling out sounds with more bass instead of high tones like phones ringing. They have very little pressure from the cancellation circuitry compared to other noise cancelling headphones I've tried, and I can wear them for hours at a time with no discomfort.  They sound great, amazing how good they sound on my computer, they even sound good on my Sangean portable radio.For the money Bose charges, the cans should provide better noise isolation before the cancelling circuitry is turned on.  I used to have a pair of Panasonic noise cancelling headphones that blocked a good amount of noise before turning on the cancelling. I would recommend these headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I understand that the sound quality is not up to the mark for audiophiles. But if you do not own a BW or Paradigm reference speakers or $500 headphones, Bose will be a big leap for you in terms of sound.But what makes these headphones a joy to use is the noise cancellation. Its black magic. its that good! Everything sounds better, because you can hear it properly. Even at home, its a big help. Humming refigerators, rattling dishwashers, mixer blenders, all of it just disappears. Its awesome!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"absolutely NOTHING else compares to these headphones in the realm of sound cancelling ability. They are comfortable, sound great, work great, and only need one AAA batt to run for 30-40 hours of use."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have never like Bose as a company. I have had terrible customer service and I seem to run into proprietary design that does not allow me to do what I want. I hate Bose....And, I keep ending with their headphones because they hit a sweat spot for me. I had the QC3. They were slightly more comfortable than the QC15s and the sound seems comparable. The QC15s seem a little more cheaply made but the noise canceling is better.I am not an audiophile but I seem to like pretty good headphones. I also don't seem willing to go much over $300 for a set of headphones. I have found some that sound better for more but not good enough for my ears. In this price range I have found nothing that has the QC15s mix of good sound, good noise canceling and comfort and I tried quite a few.My daughter has the new Beats. They feel stouter but the sound is not as good nor is the noise canceling although the price is comparable. Of course these don't look as cool or so my daughter tells me. My wife has a comparably priced pair of Audi Technica (or Senhauser? - can't remember). Hers are a little more comfortable and seem stouter as well but again sound and noise canceling are not as good. I managed to try about 6 different headphones in this price range and the QC15s came out on top.I guess I am stuck with Bose for another few years and believe me I would much prefer another company."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Still not convinced these are worth what they cost - but they are very comfortable for wearing for long periods of time. Noise reduction seems to be par for other cheaper models -- but these are comfy.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm only giving 4 stars here because I don't think that these are anything extraordinary versus other $300 headphones. However, I do find them to be extremely comfortable, and playing music (even at very low volumes) is extremely effective at suppressing office chatter. I really like the fact that they come with both a regular cable for use with 1/8 stereo jack, as well as an Apple-specific cable which includes a mic and volume/pause controls. The carrying case is outstanding as well, it allows you to throw them in your backpack with no worries about damage. Battery life is pretty good, I use Eneloop and only replace the battery (with another rechargeable) every several days, after listening all day long in the office."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is my 2nd pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones. Here's what you should need to know.Noise cancelling - The Bose are the best noise-cancelling technology going today. But realize that noise cancelling means noises that are constant, like fans, engine noise and the usual din of modern life. While they will lessen the noise of a screaming baby, they won't cancel the baby out. But if someone wants to still talk to you, they can, without scaring you out of your wits.Sound quality - These headphones are audiophile quality. Now, before the golden eared snobs start up, realize this. Like most headphones, they only amplify what's put into them. Most people use these headphones with iPods or iPhones. That means mp3 files, which are inferior audio files to begin with, especially harsh  in the upper registers. Put a good DAC between these and the audio file and you have an audiophile experience that's great. Plenty of accurate bass, good mids and satisfactory treble. Comfort is the best of any headphone I've worn. Great sounding headphone are that great if your head isn't comfortable.Build quality - This is THE BIGGEST ISSUE with these headphones. They are fragile. I had a pair of QC2's. The plastic covering the headbands cracked and fell off a couple of year's after I bought them. I wrapped black electrical tape around the plastic and used them for another nine years. Was I disapponted? Yes. $300 headphones should last longer before breaking. Last week, I took them back to the Bose store and they offer a trade-in program. Is it the best deal? No, but it's better than nothing. What other company lets you trade in 11 year headphones and get new QC15s for $129? At least Bose admits to their product defect years after the warranty expired.People don't realize, when you like headphones, especially for noise reduction, the hours quickly add up. Taking them on and off, occasionally sitting on them, perspiration from sitting on your ears all day, all cause wear and tear.Unfortunately, Bose has improved on the headphone's flimsy quality, but not by much.Considering the dreck headphones and in-ear junk now sold for over $200, the Bose headphones represent a good value, but in a fragile package.If you're rough on things. or want to go jogging everyday with headphones on,, do not buy these headphones. If you use them for an occasional plane trip and the occasional bedtime music or audio book session, you'll be very pleased with these. Just put some money away in the bank for your next pair."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I writing this review as Bose longtime customer and recent victim of counterfeit Bose QC15 headphones purchased from non-authorized Bose seller - as warning for all users to avoid expensive imitations. I have recently purchased pair of Bose QC15 Limited Edition from reputable eBay seller for a premium price above the retail value of this model. Although item location was listed as in US, I got suspicious when tracking number was showing product being shipped from Hong Kong. Immediately after receiving product, despite of looking perfectly genuine as my other pair of QC15, I verified its serial number by contacting Bose US and Bose HK. They both confirmed that serial number is invalid which along with the fact it was shipped from HK made the pair I received  a possible counterfeit. One way or the other I the warranty card is not valid with invalid serial number, so make sure to purchase these only from Bose-authorized seller or directly through Amazon. Always log in to Bose and validate serial number to make sure you have genuine product you paid for."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is my second QC15.  My first was unfortunately lost on a previous trip to Europe.  This one is identical to the previous from what I can tell but the inclusion of the iPhone control is nice.  The control might be a little to close to the headset but it's not a real problem, just different from my other controls."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Great sound, great comfort and amazing noise-cancelling capabilities.  The attachments make it perfect for my new I-Pod and works as represented when on an airplane. I've bought numerous cheaper models (at a collective cost that exceeds this product) and have not been satisfied with any other headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are the most comfortable, most effective noise cancelling headphones, and the audio quality is amazing. Here's why I recommend them.1. I totally disagree with the negative comments about this not having enough bass. As I write this review I've been listening to One Republic's Counting Stars, Adele's Rolling In The Deep, and Lady Gaga's Telephone, all of which have lots of hard driving bass. They sound great--and my iPhone 4S volume is only at the half way point.The music sounds clean and crisp--no muddiness at all. Every instrument on my jazz and classical favorites is clearly articulated, and with no tinniness or excessive treble. Bose is known for a very mellow, smooth sound. If I close my eyes I feel like I'm at the Blue Note or Lincoln Center in Manhattan depending on the selection.Note: If you don't require noise cancellation and want headphones that are much less expensive and sound great, I recommend theJBL J55i High-Performance On-Ear Headphones with JBL Drivers, Rotatable Ear-Cups and Microphone - Black2. When I travel and just want to sleep, I turn on the White Noise app on my iPhone. With the Bose noise cancellation and that app it's like being in a cocoon. I don't hear any noise on a plane or the radio in the car.3. This comes with two sets of audio cords--one for Apple products and the other for non Apple products. The Apple product cord lets me easily control the volume on my iPhone 4S and also make and receive phone calls. When I called my wife she said my voice sounded nice and clear. No tunnel sound at all. And of course her voice was crystal clear because it was coming through these headphones.These run on a single AAA battery, which is included and is very economical.4. Bose customer service is amazing. I had a ten year old pair of Bose Quiet Comfort Q2 headphones where the earpieces had become ragged and part of the headset clip was taped where I had broken it. I also had no receipt. I brought them into the Bose store and asked about replacing the foam earpieces (which cost $35). The Bose salesperson said that for $129 I could trade in my old headphones and buy the brand new Q15 complete with a new warranty, which I did.So if you have any prior model of the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, go into a Bose store and you can upgrade (at least for now) to this latest model for $129.Bottom line: Bose products are not cheap, but you definitely get your money's worth. I love these headphones, and bought another pair on Amazon for a family member.Note:  I don't recommend using these at the beach or poolside because they are too hot to wear on a warm day. I use theBose SIE2 Sport Headphones - Green.I also don't recommend them for the gym--too bulky and not water resistant, so your sweat can zap them. For the gym, especially for running on the treadmill, I recommend theAvantree Jogger Pro Sweat Proof Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Stereo Headphones / Headsets with microphone for running / sports - Black/Grey."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Mainly use the headphones while traveling on airplanes. Does an excellent job of cancelling out the constant drone of the jet engines and the miscellaneous noises in the cabin. When used in conjunction with an ipod, almost all the noise is eliminated. However, if they announce that the plane is about the crash, you may not hear it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm flying 2-3x per month and this is hands down the best product I have bought in a long time! It cuts down the noise from the jet engines and crying babies by 60-80%. I used to get off the plane feeling fatigued from all the noise, but now I just turn them on and its very quiet! The quality of the sound from music & movies is very good (not exceptional), but a heck of a lot better than my sony headphones. I was very skeptical, but after using these on the last 10-15 flights I will never fly again without them!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"1) The product *stank* when it arrived. Not just the usual horrible BPA plastic smell, I'd have preferred that to this. Somehow Bose managed to use a plastic in the carrying case that made the product smell to me like it had come from a smoker's house. Awful. Not sure if they sent me reconditioned ones by mistake or what. I'm hoping it'll wear off over time.2) I'd have really liked a 3 position switch. Off, On, On + Noise Reduction.  As it is, it's noise reduction or nothing, which I can see the point of from the whole Bose purist thing, but for tech reasons I'd have liked to have had a way of comparing to see how much volume I'm not having to use to hear the music when the NR is kicked in. Either way, this is great. I work in an atmosphere with a *lot* of computer/heating/ac fan noise. I hadn't realized how much until I put these on then flick the ON switch. It's like someone flipped the 'mute' switch on the world. Wow.  I've had a lot of fun letting other people put these on, get used to the ambient room noise, then flip the switch and watch their mouth drop.Aside from the excellent sound repro, a huge plus point for me is that I can actually wear these for long periods. I must have a larger head than normal or something because other headphones I've tried eventually really hurt my head where the top crossbar presses down on the skull, no matter how much padding they include. These ones do not, they actually expand enough. 10/10 for that."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Recently purchased these for work, I did a lot of research and tested a lot of phones before deciding on these. The NC is not really essential for me as I don't work in a noisy environment. But I found it to be such a nice feature. The sound quality is of the best I have ever heard. I plugged my iPod into several phones at the store to do a side by side comparison, and these bad boys were so superior to everything else I tried. The only drawback is having to replace the batterie. I also do not like that you have to have the NC turned on to listen to music, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but it does increase sound quality. If you've got the clams you won't be disappointed with the Bose quiet comfort 15 headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Overall love these headphones; very happy with fit, sound, and battery life - which I'm averaging a 'month' of use at work with a solid 4-5 hours per day of use on non-rechargables. Minus half a star for no passive mode...these are headphones and shouldn't need a battery to operate, even if it's in non-NR mode."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am a frequent international traveler and fly over the Pacific very often. My ears are very sensitive with high pitches and whine, so I get quickly tired with background noise especially those ones from cheap headphones. And I am forced to unnecessarily raise the volume because conversation scenes can be frustrating at times with that kind of headphones on. Doing so is not only hassle but also not healthy to my ears. For that matter, these headphones perfectly filtered the natural noise of the airplane and I could enjoy the movie without constantly adjusting the volume. It cover your ears very comfortably as well. I highly recommend this to travelers like me.*This review was originally written for the older version, but since the only difference is the new cable with phone controls, I am writing here too for those who need an opinion from actual frequent flyer."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Voice quality is great, but as pointed out in other reviews, if it is just to listen to music, you may like other products based on the genre of music that you listen to.My reason for buying this product was for Air travel and Noise suppression. This being a key factor, I selected QC-15 over QC-3Engine noise suppression is the best in class.Interestingly, under normal operation, you can hear people speaking. This for me is a plus, if you are listening to music at home. But on the plane, thankfully it mutes out the sound  of crying children and lets you rest or sleep in peace.Overall, I got of the plane feeling rested and was able to deal with jet lag better. I take long flights (10 ~ 15 hour flights). The ears feel a bit sore initially if you use the headset for such a long time. But I think I will get adjusted to it with usage, and the fit is overall very comfortable.Also, I can listen to music or audio at lower volume levels on the flight, which is overall better for in the long run.The case is quite sturdy, and has some extra space. I have a Motorola S9-HD bluetooth headset that I also pack in the case to use when I hit the gym for workouts."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My first pair wore out after 10 years, and I hope these will last as long. I use them constantly, eight months a year, when I'm out in my garden working, with my iPod nano, so they get a serious workout. I also use them inside when my neighbor guns his 4-wheeler and dirt bikes a hundred feet from my house--they are the only thing that saves my sanity. I have one average ear and one that sticks out a bit, and these ear cups are deep enough that I can wear them for 4 hours comfortably. The headband is &#34;okay&#34; comfortable, not great, it could be better, but I don't know of any headphone that compares for fidelity and sound quality. I used it to rate my AudioTechnica ATH-M30's and was surprised how much more I heard with the Bose. If you live in a noisy environment and you crave quiet, I suggest you try these. They were great in my cubicle, too, before I retired. Got a lot more work done. Felt a bit self-conscious at first because they were so big, but that only lasted half a day. And I wouldn't think of flying without them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is definitely the craziest noise canceling I have ever heard....or didn't hear...wait. I'm confused now.I first tried these on in Best Buy. As soon as I placed them over my hears, all the store noise was gone. Didn't hear anything! Then I pressed play on the display and a nice crisp sound was coming through. Still having my hand on the display I felt the whole display shaking like an earthquake. I thought to myself 'what is going on'. Then the person speaking to me in the headphones asked me to take them off my head for a minute and surprize surprize! That whole time I felt the shaking a speaker that was right in front of my face was BLARING this really awfully loud noise and I didn't even know it! Insane!I work in a very noisy environment with a printer that sits right next to my cubicle that drives me absolutely insane. The air conditioner vent is also right above my cube which is also a nuisance. So I bit the bullet and bought these headphones.It blocks the printer noise and air conditioner noise out. It even blocks out the sound of me typing on my keyboard. It doesn't, however, block out people talking as much, but if you have music playing you definitely wont hear them.These headphones are VERY comfortable!I am a music producer/DJ and headphone fanatic so I own a lot of different headphones and these things I cant even tell I have on after wearing them for even an hour +.Some people complain about they make your ears hot and sweaty. I'm not a very sweaty person, and I own headphones that are a lot worse so I didn't notice that problem with these headphones as bad. A brief 5 second lift off every 30 minutes to an hour was good enough for me.The sound itself is very clean and crisp. I also tried on the Beatz by Dre at best buy and I though the BOSE were 10x more comfortable, better constructed, sound cleaner, and the noise cancelation isn't even a comparison. They might not have as much bass as the Beatz, but I don't like too much bass pumping directly into my ear drum.As I mentioned, I am a music producer and a DJ, so if anything, for personal listening I prefer to use less volume on my ears and save the ear punishment for when I am mixing. These headphones with the noise canceling allow me to keep the volume at a VERY low level and still hear the music as it was intended.All that being said, as much as I love these headphones I think I may have to return them. They are great for casual listening but aren't very useful in a studio recording / tracking situation. The sound is too colored (not flat). So the only use I can see these for is personal enjoyment in the office, which I can't justify the 300 price tag for.Also, I light to travel lightly. These headphones come with a very nice case, but I cannot see carrying this around with me everywhere I go. Feels almost like an old oversized portable Sony Discman case.The mandatory need for battery power provided or the headphones do not operate at all also isn't my style.I should also mention that these headphones DO bleed. Meaning, if someone was sitting near you and you had the volume turned up I'd say halfway, they will probably hear what you are listening to. Full volume and everyone will be jamming to your tunes. You usually won't have to turn them up high though with the noise canceling, but headphone bleed is a BIG no no for me. I don't like hearing other people's headphones so I wouldn't expect anyone to have to listen to mine.I'd say if I didn't already own a bazillion other headphones and the BOSE QuietComfort 15's offered a useful role in my recording studio other than blocking out the computer sound then I consider keeping them and if they didn't absolutely require battery power I would more than likely keep them. But 300 just for personal use to block out office noises that are fairly blocked out with the use of ear buds I cannot justify.Maybe if I run into an exuberant amount of cash flow in the future I may repurchase. Hopefully by then they will have a model that operates even without battery power.  =)"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Its a bit pricey but this headset is really high quality. The noise reduction is amazing. Immersive experience. I love it.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've used Bose QC headphones since they have been on the market, almost. My QC2s, around 5-6 years old, started to generate static when bumped. I called Bose and asked if there was a trade-up program, even though the warranty was expired. They said ""Yep - send the old ones in, and we will sell you a replacement set - now the QC-15, for around $125!!!  What a deal! Since I not registered the old ones with Bose - I could have found an old set at Goodwill, and gotten the same deal..... I'm not advocating doing that butThey sent the QC15s the same day, I got the 2 days later - long before they got my old ones!No idea why the ""best negative review"" is several years old. It states among other things, that these have no volume control. The certainly do! Along with a mute button if you're using them with iphones, and a track skip button. All on one single button device, about 6-8 inches down the cord from the headset.These provide even more noise cancellation than the old ones, which were already very good at this feature. They do not cancel out certain noises, like human voices, unless you are playing music. Music itself pretty much cancels out all external noise.A nice case is provided. Again, some reviews said the new case does not have a separate zippered compartment for spare batteries and airplane adapter. Again - not true. The case looks almost identical to my old one.Highly recommended - good quality, long life (in my case), and excellent customer service.The line is indeed thin. It may not last for years, but then again - my old one had no issue with the cords."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The Bose QC 15 is the first noise cancellation headphones I've tried out. After trying them out for couple of hours today, I was feeling uncomfortable with it. I read some articles regarding noise cancellation technology causing dizziness and nausea due to low frequency sounds causing sensitive inner ears to vibrate.Well, I'm going to return this headphones since they were causing discomfort."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Why I purchased:- Needed a new pair of headphones- I work in a rather noisy office and needed something that could provide active noise canceling- Had to have headphones that sit around the ear instead of directly on the earPros:- I've bought Bose products before so I knew I could expect great quality. Given that, I was still completely blown away with how comfortable these headphones are.- Very effective noise canceling- Sound quality is exactly what one would expect from Bose- Includes a nice case to keep them safeCons:- Not really a con, but just be aware that these headphones do require a AAA battery for the noise canceling. Be sure to keep a spare battery in your carrying case."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Required for trans-pacific flights. Quite happy with these.It is true that they are worthless when the battery is dead, but the battery life is decent."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've bought many headphones having to travel on long international flights several times a year. Anyone whose traveled by jet aircraft can attest to how the high pitched engine noise can affect you. If you don't understand this try a pair of Bose headphones during a long flight, the calm, quiet difference becomes major when it blocks out everything except the music or sheer silence. I feel so much more relaxed and better after a flight when I have my Bose. Movies and music really do sound that much better, I hear things I never heard before while wearing these head phones.I've owned some Sony noise canceling Headphones, some in the ear Costco lightweight phones, some Maxwell (Walmart $40) over the ear headphones as a comparison. At first I could not accept the concept that I had to spend $300 on headphones. What it comes down to is you're paying for quality and you'll note the volume of people on planes who also have paid the price and own Bose.The sound quality is one part, the materials stand out as they are the only head phones I can wear for 12 hours which don't hurt my head or ears. My ears don't sweat like the Maxwell's did, they block out far more noise than the Sony's and Costco's. When you switch on the noise reduction you instantly notice the difference. In fact the new QC15's listen to the volume of noise and adjustautomatically. I now can turn the volume down on my ipod and laptop when I play movies and music. It just sounds better and due to the great isolation you hear more."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The sound quality on these headphones is wonderful. I'd forgotten how nice real over the ear headphones could sound after years of using earbuds but these converted me back. The noise canceling features work well and really reduce the background noise on my commute (the BART trains of the SF Bay Area).My only complaint is the lack of support for Android phones as controllable music players. You have to use the plain cable with your Android phone or you won't even get stereo sound, also the controls don't work for the Android devices. I've tried it on a Samsung Galaxy SII, a Motorola Droid Mini, and a Google Nexus 7. Plug it into the iPhone 4S or 5S or a Mac Laptop and everything is perfect.  Bose doesn't advertise support for Android, but I really think they should. And before you think you can just find a third party cable - don't bother.  As of the time I write this there is only one, and it flips the L and R channels which really annoys some.Add full Android support and this becomes a five star review."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Dramatic title to this comment but maybe true. I am super noise sensitive. Thus I find these head phones are a god send if a god could ease the annoyance of loud neighbors and other noises. I have worn them to bed when I cannot sleep. The music play back through them is great. When I need to simply relax in life, I put them on and go into my quiet comfort zone. MORE than a pair of mere headphones. I wish I could enclose my house in them ;-)"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I don't use these much at home, but they really are wonderful on an airplane.  Flying is a much less miserable experience with my Bose headphones.  Even if there's a screaming baby 3 seats away, I simply pop these on and crank up the volume until the little monsters just sound like a faint, distant echo very far away."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have been looking for a good sent of noise canceling headphones. My son visits during his breaks from school and he likes to study in the room right off the TV room. I got him a cheaper set from Brookstone a while back, and although he liked them he said they didn't really work all that well. So, I got these based on the comments here.They really did the job. Although no headphones will really completely block off external sound, these come close. You simply put the battery on (one AA) and you put it on and immediately external noise is quieted. If you use the cord you can attach it to your computer or iPod  or phone and combined with the music, you won't hear anything outside of that headset.The music itself is is divine - the perfect balance of high and low. Plus and this is a huge plus for me, this is the most plush and comfortable headphones I've ever used. I can wear them for hours.Highly highly recommended. I am glad I got them. Just be sure to have an extra battery handy in case the one in the headphones wears out."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I purchased these after much debate and more than a few recommendations.  I am glad I finally pulled the trigger on them.  They make flying on a plane so much easier as all that engine noise just goes away.  Now these are not &#34;noise isolating&#34; so they won't really drown out voices since the cancellation algorithm doesn't see that as &#34;noise.&#34; Nut even so it will mute them a little bit so they aren't as noticeable.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these as Christmas gifts for my son and husband (and got one for me too). I can barely get them off my husband's head these days. He relaxes in his &#34;man chair&#34; with them and tunes out all the stress. My son travels for business, and he loves screening out plane noise. They feel great on the ears, and you really feel like you're in your own safe little world when you wear them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased a unit several months ago and recently purchased another pair, (no better unit).I mention a plane in my title only because in my research, the vast majority of people and manufacturers talk about noise canceling on a plane.  Do 99% of the people who use noise canceling headsets want them for planes?  Personally, I want them for the office, workouts at the gym while on a treadmill, and on a rare occasion while on a jet, not that I go on one all that often, hardly ever.That being said, I was able to test on a business trip last November to Europe, so I can comment on it.  (My own personal comment is who cares.  If you travel every day, okay, but once or twice a year, is it worth commenting on?)Notes* Noise Canceling: I do not mean to be picky, but I have not tried any headset, and I tried quite a few, which are ""noise canceling"".  Headsets, these included, are ""Noise Reducing"".Airplane / Jet* With all the talk of airplanes (jets, really), I honestly thought that I would not be able to hear the engine that I would be as if I were in a quiet concert hall.  That thought was a complete fantasy.  Yes, the surrounding noise of the jets were quieted down, allowing me to hear the video, but I definitely heard the jets and the background noise.  I will not give a percentage.* I traveled on Air France, so this comment may not apply to other air craft carriers, but the sound level was either off or loud.  I could not adjust the volume to medium.  The quietest level before silence was quite loud.Gym* The same comment applies to the gym while running on a treadmil with other treadmills and bycles in the nearby area.  The background noise was quieter, but definitely there.* While on a treadmil, there is a definite thump-thump-thump on every up and down motion.  That seems to be an artifact of the noise canceling dealing with motion.General* The majority of the noise reduction is from the foam ear coverings.  The electronics adds to that.Office* Someone needs to come up with a headset that blocks out other people talking, doors opening and closing, and most importantly fans.  I work in an area, where there are lots and lots of noise fans for electronics (computers, etc.).  I so totally still here them, but at least the noise is reduced.  Talking is a bit duller, but only because of the foam.Sound Quality* I cannot really comment on that, as I an not an expert.  Music sounds okay, but hard to judge, as I still hear fans, and all sorts of other noise.I am giving a 3, but..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The more I buy/use Bose products, the more impressed I am. Noise cancellation is phenominal; you can't even hear yourself breathing. Combined with the standard Bose sound quality, listening to music is all the more amazing. It's true that you'll hear things you've never heard before in music you've heard several times before. Well worth the money."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I finally took the plunge with Bose and got these for my girlfriend.  She loves technology but isn't necessarily tech savvy, so I wanted something that had a good background of quality and comfort.  Trying these on myself, I can say that on those two fronts the QC15s are great.  We took this with us on a recent trip to Paris and had them on for hours so I can safely say that they are quite comfy.  The sound reproduction is also fantastic.  They aren't the most bass heavy of headphones, so if you do listen to a lot of low-end-heavy music, there are perhaps better options (Monster and Klipsch come to mind).  But for the majority of music and movies, the sound you get out of them is full and consistent over its frequency range.  You do get the feeling that the QC15 has been worked on and tuned to merit the somewhat hefty price tag.Of course, the major selling point with these particular headphones is the noise cancelling.  Like is stated elsewhere, you only get sound out of them if the noise cancelling is turned on.  Turn it off, the headphones do nothing.  When turned on, the noise that gets cancelled is what most would call &#34;ambient noise&#34;.  The general drone of the world around you.  Think, the sound a plane makes when inside it.  Speech isn't cancelled as aggressively, so you'll still take notice when someone starts talking to you.  I'd say this is more of a good thing actually, as you can wear them when around other people and still respond to them.If you've never used a pair of noise cancelling headphones, then don't expect the ambient sound to just vanish.  Instead of cancelling, think of it as lessening.  It's there but is drowned down to the point where the music or whatever you're listening to is no longer impaired by it.  Think something akin to how earbud headphones work.  When you pause your music with earbuds on, you can still heard the world, but turn the music back on and it is no longer audible.I can't speak to the battery life yet as the original batteries haven't died yet.  That being said, thus far they've lasted for many hours (10+).The general build of the headphones is solid.  The battery compartment has a door that swings open but stays connected to the set, so that's nice.  You don't notice its there when it's closed, and in fact it was a little hard to find when I initially got them.  The 3.5mm cable unplugs from the set and can be stored separately, which is a nice touch.  Don't worry though, the connection doesn't feel loose so you aren't in danger of it coming unplugged accidentally.  You also get an extra iPod cable, with music controls and an plane adapter.Overall, the QC15 are a great pair of headphones but only if you need or want the noise cancelling, since they don't work unless you turn it on.  For travel, there's really nothing better.  Combine the quality, comfort, and noise cancelling and it's almost a must have."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Bought it as a gift for my brother! He fell in love with it. Could not believe what great sound it has as well as the noise cancelling feature that is ideal for his travels and love for music. Great gift!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'll admit, like others, I had reservations about dropping $300+ on a pair of headphones... These things are unreal! Build quality is impeccable, sound quality is great, and noise cancelling FAR surpasses expectations. These are not your $50 noise cancelling headphones. If you've tried the cheapo versions in the past and aren't sold on the technology, seriously try the QC-15's! There is no comparison... The range of destructive frequencies is much larger, and unlike the cheaper versions, these headphones have sampling mics both on the outside and inside. The result is absolutely incredibly noise reduction, even with high-frequency noise, which is something the cheaper versions fail to suppress well.I am seriously in love with these things. My only complaint is the inability to listen to music unless the noise reduction mode is on. Luckily however, these headphones use a single AAA battery, which is very easy and convenient to replace."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Definitely worth the extra $$$. I was hesitant, as I've owned about three other brands of noise canceling headphones, but none compare to these. Great for the airplane at drowning out the plane engines, A/C and passenger side conversations!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Pretty good headset.  I use them on my computer and they are quite a bit louder than my other ($50 headphones).  This is nice, the sound cancelling isn't anywhere near as effective as I expected.  They basically remove a lot of the ambient noise but you'll still hear even relatively quiet sounds happening around you.  I also use this set as a headset while flying with an adapter and the noise cancelling doesn't do much, though they are very light and comfortable.I'm glad I purchased them, use them daily and would definitely recommend."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,One of the best noise cancellation headphones I've ever had in my entire life! Awesome quality and really pure rich sound with no one bothering you around while you watch movies or music best for sleep! I recommend this product buy it now before it's too late! A+++
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought this pair to replace my old, below fifty bucks, Koss on which I usually play random music to drown out background chatter. On the upside, the QC2's noise cancellation is superb. However, the sound quality is no better than the Koss, and may be even be worse in many cases.What bothered me more is that I have to manually turn on the noise cancellation, and it is *not* optional, in case I just want to listen to music or news without burning the batteries. This proved to be a big annoyance: I use headphones 6-8 hours a day at my desk, but need noise cancellation may be for an hour max in the whole day. Why on earth should I then need to burn batteries in the phone for all the 8 hours rather than 1??? It makes no sense to me ...Sent it back. Bose should re-think this product. At any rate, the noise cancellation and ordinary use needs to be decoupled. Simple sound production should be possible without turning on noise cancellation. Even when noise cancellation is turned on, the default power source should be the cord, if plugged in. The battery should be needed *only* when the headphone is being used only for noise cancellation without the cord on."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Things I wish I knew before these were in my hands.1. Without the battery and noise canceling turned on, these don't do anything. I expected with it off that they'd still be great headphones, just no noise canceling. Nope. They have to be turned on to do anything.2. I purchased these because I wanted the person next to me not to be annoyed by hearing the music I am. I tried on a pair of Sony 7510 and I expect the HD 280 pro (the other recommendation I got) would do this better for less $.The sound quality is great and the headphone quality I expect to last quite a while as per my experience with my other Bose product."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'll save the long winded review for the rest of the reviewers, but I'll say that of all the other noise cancelling headphones I've used, these are by far the best.  Some others may produce slightly superior sound quality, but none yet have managed to match Bose's noise cancelling abilities.  On a plane, the sound just melts away when they're turned on.  Even when I'm not listening to music, I still have these on with the headphone jack unplugged to tune out all the ambient engine noise.  With music on, there could be a gunfight 10 feet away and you wouldn't hear it.Passive noise isolation VS active noise cancellation:  Passive isolation of noise would be like using earplugs or other hearing protection.  Sound is reduced by physically blocking the sound waves from entering your ear by means of a physical barrier.  Actively cancelling the noise is done by creating sound waves that are 180 degrees out of phase with the lower frequency noise that is intended to be reduced, effectively ""erasing"" the sound as far as your ears are concerned.  All headphones have the former to a certain extent.  The more expensiveBose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphonesare ON EAR and are Bose's ""Told Ya We Could Do It"" answer by massively reducing ambient noise using primarily noise cancellation with minimal isolation.  The QC15s use BOTH, as they are OVER THE EAR so not only do they cancel noise electronically, they isolate it mechanically.  I've used both (a friend who seeks comfort in knowing he has the most expensive thing available has the QC3s) and I'm happy to report the 15s produce superior noise cancelling and, as a result, better sound quality.Battery life is phenomenal, I'm yet to replace them and have taken multiple international flights.  The substantial molded ballistic zipper case (not unlike the zipper cases that Oakley makes) is GREAT, and has a zipper pocket inside for spare batteries.  It also includes ""information cards"" about the headphones because Bose apparently hopes that your desire to brag about your expensive headphones will afford them free advertising.  Mine took a one way trip to the circular file and were replaced with my own business card, although I'm assuming if someone stumbles upon some lose Bose headphones it's pretty unlikely they won't declare Finders Keepers on them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these and the audio technica ones. The noise-cancelling is about 99% the same- but the comfort is why i stuck with the bose.  If you travel not that often- the audio technica ones are fine, but if you travel more, or have a large head like me. then go for the bose.cases and accessories are legit exactly the same."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Price: hands-down, these are excessively priced.Audio quality: Very good, but not excellent for the price. If you care more about audio quality, look elsewhere.Noise cancellation: Works very well, especially for repeated / prolonged noises such as A/C, refrigerator, engine noises. Not very effective on people chatting, especially when there is no sound/music.One important issue is how it feels without any sound source, i.e. turned on but with nothing being played. Noise canceling creates this feeling of 'air pressure' on the ear that does not feel like being in a quiet room. Colleagues using the same product reported some headache if used only in this way. It certainly does not feel natural.I have used a colleague's Logitech headphones (for a much shorter time) and they seemed to have similar noise cancellation abilities. Those were priced similarly though.Comfort: pretty comfortable. Completely covers my ears, not heavy at all. Padding is soft and pleasant.Other aspects: cord is long enough, not very long though. On/off switch makes an unpleasant sound when switched on."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these to use in a distracting open office environment, and they are EXCELLENT.  If you turn on noise-cancelling and don't play music, you'll definitely hear the voices around you, but once you play music at even a low volume level, most noise around you is simply non-existent.  In addition, the sound quality is really fantastic.  Great balanced sound and I'm constantly rediscovering music that I've loved for years.  You just hear so much more than with typical headphones and speakers.  Yes, the price is steep, but let me tell you...well worth it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought Bose's Noise Cancelling Headphones a few weeks ago at the airport on my way to Switzerland and it definitely made the trip more bearable. It was also nice to not have to increase the volume to harmful levels when watching movies. When you put them on, you immediately notice a significant reduction in ambient noise but once you turn it on, the reduction in noise is pretty radical. It almost feels like you're under water. You really have to experience it to see what it's like. You can still somewhat hear conversations/other noises around you but any type of repetitive background noise is almost completely gone."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are truly amazing headphones.  My hearing is not the best and I have trouble listening to movies on airplanes on my iPad, even with the volume up all the way.  The constant sound of the plane combined with the fairly low sound output of an iPad even at full volume rendered my inexpensive headphones ineffective on my last cross-country plane trip, much to my dismay.  These Bose QC 15s are the answer.  Their outstanding attribute is the noise cancelling feature.  It is quite literally astounding.  When noise cancelling headphones first came out a few decades ago I thought that it was mostly a gimmick.  (I can remember when scientists said that true noise cancelling was impossible to achieve.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote a short story on that subject, believe it or not.)  Well, hearing is believing.  One can sit in a noisy room and flick these headphones on and off and hear how the noise cancelling feature simply eliminates the background sounds.  I picked the QC 15  because it is the over-the-ear model and I wanted and need (for trips) the maximum amount of sound elimination.  But it is the noise cancelling electronics in the headphone, not the physical ear muff, that gets rid of most of the background noise.Sound reproduction fidelity with these headphones is outstanding; what you would expect from Bose.  It sounds like you are in the presence of the true sounds, not listening with headphones.  These headphones make watching/listening to movies on an iPad or Kindle Fire a real pleasure.  For airplane trips, for me at least, they are absolutely essential.I also selected the QC 15 model because it uses a AAA battery for power.  These batteries are easy to find and carry, and I did not want to have to hassle with recharging the headphones.  This is not practical on plane flights.  I just keep a couple of extra AAA batteries in the Bose case that comes with these headphones and I am good to go for an entire trip.Pretty much everything about these headphones is exemplary.  The really outstanding feature is the noise cancelling performance of these headphones.  If this attribute is important to you, these Bose headphones are the ones to get.  This is not important to all users, but on a plane it is an essential feature to me; otherwise I simply cannot hear the movie adequately.Highly recommended without reservation.  RJB."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've been using QC3's for a few years now, they've always been my trusted head phones for flights - lots of them The downside was the cable needed replacement every year or so and the ear pads every couple of years - not a big deal to me. Finally, the left ear phone lost connection, I could wiggle the cable to get it back but not get it to stick.  Came home into DCA the first flight this happened and bought a pair of Parrot ZiKs. Incredible sound but they're super heavy.  The top of my head hurt after an hour or so. Decided to try the QC15. So for, so good but haven't been on a long flight with them yet. I like that they use off the shelf batteries. they feel light. Not sure about the rest yet. Will update as I get more time in the air but so far, I like them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have owned many NR headset and this is my 4th Bose QuietComfort. I've owned all the previous versions and do like these the best. It does an amazing job, especially on a plane where the background noise production is amazing. The sound quality is amazing too.Pros:-Excellent Noise Reduction-Excellent Sound-Very comfortable-The single battery lasts a very long time (many months with regular use)Cons:-My major complaint is padding. They use a cheap heat seal that will break with time. Every Bose QuietComfort headset I have owned has this seal wear out and the sponge padding becomes exposed. For such an expensive headset you would expect a much better quality ear padding that would last. This is my only real disappointment with these but it is very significant because it has happened with every pair so it's not just a matter of one having a flaw.-You cannot use the headset without turning on the NR function. If your battery dies and you do not have a backup the headset cannot be used. Its not only that the NR will not work of course, there is no sound at all without the unit turned on"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Just awesome performance . I have other Bose products in my house and would never consider any other product. These headphones are  very comfortable and silence  95 per cent of background noise.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have had several pairs of higher end headphones meaning Sennheiser, Beats, other Bose models. But when I put these on I was transformed to a whole different word. I got lost into the crispness of songs that I never heard before. The added benefit was there was nothing on the outside that I could hear to take my attention away from the music. My search for the right headphone set has come to an end. LOVE these!!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought this twice and had to return it twice, but I still like it.The first time I got it, the seams on the case's zipper was coming off.  Since this is a product where you want to use the case on the daily basis, I decided to return it for a replacement as soon as I got it.The second time I got it, I used it for a week on various conditions (office, light rail train, and regular train (CalTrain)).  It's really the best noise cancelling headphone, and works well with both trains.  The reason I returned it the second time was that voice cancelling in the office was not good enough and I didn't want to spend too much money on a pair of headphone that doesn't cover that.  I have at least 5 co workers that use them in the daily basis and it was good enough for them since they listen to music with it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The headphones got the best noise cancelling around, not good, not better, but the BEST and I'll give it that! However, I was shocked at the face that you CANNOT play ANY audio with the NC feature off. Yup! it's either on or you'll hear nothing!Never mind! After 8 hours of constant audio playing with NC feature on I started feeling dizziness, nuance, discomfort! So much for a headphones that is branded as ""QuiteComfort"" eh? wasn't the headphones designed for long distance traveling, they should've prevented these side effects! and in order to use it daily, you have to change AAA batteries, or charge it if it's made out of lithium!finally, I bought the headphones to use it everyday and turn on the NC when traveling! Just why can't I play with the noise cancelling feature off? d*** move bose, D*** MOVE!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel frequently by air and had been wanting to try these for some time. Received this as a gift right before a long international trip, and these lived up to the high ratings and my high expectations. As straight headphones, they're quite comfortable and I had no problem wearing them for extended periods on the plane. The sound from music and movies is SO much better than earbuds ay any price, I was amazed at the clarity. Noise cancellation was very good as long as your not expecting total silence. They did an exellent job at eliminating most of the background noise in the airplane. I was surprised by the battery life. I wore these constantly on flights from the US to Hong Kong, to Bangkok, to India, to the UK and back to the US, and one battery lasted the entire trip. THese are pricey but for me they're worth it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,If you want awesome headphones you can get better sound quality at half the cost of these Bose.  They really shine with noise cancelling.  Definitely worth the money IMO.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased the Bose QC15 headphones primarily for use during long, intercontinental flights. They are wonderful. Plug them into your computer, smartphone, Ipod , the plane's headphone outlet or what have you, click on some music and kick back for the next 9 hours or so. These headphones really do silence out the din of the other passengers, as well as the droning of the aircraft engines and that air circulation hiss, while allowing you to be aware that your travel companion or the flight attendant is speaking to you. Thing is, you cannot clearly make out what they are saying, so if you want, you can just pretend you do not hear and go blissfully on listening to whatever. In researching these, I came across reviews that questioned the sonic fidelity, etc of these headphones. I am not a recording engineer or headphone guru, but these headphones sound perfectly fine to me. Frankly, I doubt that I could hear some of the things that the critics write about anyway. Besides which, I did not buy these headphones to sit in my  living room to listen to the 160 microphone, latest digital technology recording of a symphony orchestra or the thumping bass laden gangster rap recording of the latest MC Whoever. I bought them to provide me an envelope of relative quiet while flying on airliners, and that they do very well. My one complaint would be the fact that you cannot use the headphones as just regular headphones in the event that your batteries go dead. If the battery goes dead, then the headphones are dead. Luckily, the batteries are just generic AAA's, nothing exotic, built-in or proprietary. My solution, stick an extra set of batteries in the carrying case. Problem sort of solved."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm easily annoyed by the wrong kind of sound. The major reason I bought these was the toddler living in the condo above mine. She runs back and forth and back and forth, and it had become one of those straw/camel's back things that was truly making me crazy.I wondered if this noise-cancelling technology would work on that sort of noise. From what I'd read, I didn't have high hopes that it could help block structure-borne noise, which is almost equally perceptible as felt-vibration as it is heard-sound (if that makes sense). That was one reason I put off spending the $300 on these -- thinking they wouldn't work on the sound that bugged me most.Now I wish I'd bought them years ago. They're pricey AND they're worth every stinking penny. No, I can't say they always entirely block out that particular stomping/running noise, but they DO muffle it to a point where I'm hardly aware of it, which is a miracle. And that's with no music... just the noise-canceling turned on. (Yet when someone is speaking directly to me, I can hear, no problem.) When listening to music, I'm not aware of any sound coming from upstairs.I adore these headphones. They're comfortable enough that I can wear them for hours with really no discomfort... a slight sense of relief when first removing them, but the tradeoff in being able to blot out so much noise is way more than worth it. I expect that they're even going to improve my blood pressure. Part of me wants to send the bill for these to my neighbors, but I'm so much less apt to get irritable now, I don't even care that much anymore."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"We tried a friends other brand and these were by far more comfortable and quieter.I had to go to the hospital for one night, and they made the stay so much better.No rattling of trays, odd conversations or bangs to wake me up.It's great to be connected with my iphone at all times."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Great headphones with good noise cancellation. I started getting pain in my ear due the noise cancellation. I am not sure if the noise cancellation is worth the pain.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Some of the reviews I read had indicated that these headphones seemed flimsy or less durable than they should be, so I was a bit worried.  I knew there was a warranty period and used my Amex card so I had doubled that period and gave them a try.  However, there is nothing to worry about.  They are lightweight, but I would not say flimsy or cheap.  I do keep them in the great case that they come in, and I am not rough on them, but they show no sign of wearing out anytime soon.The sound isolation (the part that covers your ears and seals out external noise) is great, and the set is very comfortable.  The padding does not bunch up and breathes a bit, so your ears do not sweat as with cheaper designs.The noise canceling (the electronics that actually cancel out other sounds) is amazing.  If you are an audiophile and trying to hear every time the oboe player sniffles, you may be disappointed, but if you want to enjoy music or other audio while on an airplane without damage to your ears, these are for you. I had given up listening to my iPod on airplanes when I realized how loud the volume had to be to hear anything.  I could only imagine the damage I was doing to my ears.  Just try listening to the same volume level that was fine during the flight once you get home and you will know what I mean. With the Bose QC headphones, I can relax and listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks and the time just flies by.I am very pleased with my purchase."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"There is a certain 'lightness' in the sound quality of these headphones, particularly noticeable in the treble range - guitar strums are more apparent, cymbals are more sharper, spoken words are more vivid especially for tracks that you frequent, you hear sounds and tones you wouldn't normally notice. The bass range is set about right, not too heavy but not light either. Quite frankly, if all your music is in this lower range, you'd probably won't need these. To describe my sound experience in a few words, it is as if you are suddenly listening to the tracks you frequent with more sources/channels; in classical music, I am able to isolate (for those who can play by ear) and follow the musical instruments much easier whenever I choose. The sound canceling is aggressive, and I would be interested to try other devices out there that match or exceed this.For headphones that come with noise canceling, very few come close to the QC15, and at the end of the day, if you can afford these and noise canceling is part of your checklist, by all means go ahead as you will not regret it - these headphone do deliver at the price range they are set at.Put simply, the sound quality can be easily judged if you find you are going through all your music collection to listen to them again. And for many tracks you'll hear the difference."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Overall there are a LOT better headphones out there in terms of musical performance. I have used dozens and these are just above the middle of the pack. That is not considering the noise cancellation however.The noise cancellation during airplane travel is pretty good, but I certainly was not blown away. Again, the performance is above average but not &#34;startling good&#34;. On a very good note, my last trip was a long one and I watched two full movies in relative comfort, only had the &#34;I have to scratch my ear&#34; sensation once or twice in several hours.Overall I would have given these a 3.5 out of 5 if halfsies were allowed. I won't return them and will make them part of my travel kit for sure, but for the price I was slightly let down."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have had the Sony MDR-NC6 noise canceling headphones for a couple of years now. The sound on those was 75% and the noise canceling 60%, so for the daily use they were OK, but since I started wearing them for longer periods of time, the pressure to my ears started to make then hurt. So I decided I would get a replacement that would do great in all fronts. I ended up with 2 finalists, the Beats and the Bose, both noise canceling versions. I finally decided to go with the Bose because of more consistent build quality and neutrally optimized sound as opposed to base sound optimization of the Beats. For the Bose, the noise canceling on this model is even better than its predecessor so excellent I would rate it 92% sound quality is very good, I would say 85%. The downside of these headphones is that they require the on switch not only to cancel noise but even to play music. In other words if you run out of battery, they are USELESS. So plan for a charger and at least a couple of rechargeable AAA batteries..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have had a pair of SONY, a pair  of Sennheiser and a pair of Philips headphones, all with active noise cancellation.  Although all three were good for regular listening (Sennheiser the best) , their noise reduction systems were inadequate for air travel, for which I bought them in the first place.  I have a strong bias against Bose in general as I find their products mediocre at best, and almost comically overpriced.  But after trying a pair of QC15s I reluctantly concluded that the noise cancelling system of the QC15s  is far, far superior to any other active NC headphones that I have tried, and that is why I now have a pair.  I use them for traveling exclusively.  With the QC15s it is actually possible to enjoy the music while traveling,  something not possible with my earlier mentioned headphones.  For regular home listening, as is typical with any Bose product, much better performance can be had for a fraction of the price.  The QC15,s have a hard upper mid/lower treble range, some EQ is required to avoid fatigue.  My Beyer  DT235,s (no NC) are clearly superior and cost $50.00!  BUT when traveling by air, the QC15,s are an absolute blessing, way superior to any other headphones, and for that specific purpose I wouldn't trade them for anything."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love these headphones!  I had narrowed my choices down to these and the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC9, and ultimately picked the Bose because they really were more comfortable, at least for me.  The ANC9s felt like they were applying too much pressure to my head. But it could also be that I have a larger than average head.  I thought about just bending the frame of the ANC9s out a bit, but didn't want to risk being able to return them.  So instead I opted to exchange them for the QC15s which I already knew would feel comfortable since I was able to try a demo pair in Best Buy.The noise-cancelling works very well in my office environment.  We have an air conditioner that makes a constant loud hum that can be very annoying after working all day.  These block that out completely, yet I can still hear my cell phone ring, so it does let some higher frequencies through, which is good.One thing I did like about the ANC9s is that they would work as regular headphones if there was no battery installed.  They wouldn't do active noise reduction without a battery, but you could still hear your music. With the QC15s, when the power stops, so does your music.  But I'm okay with that because I bought these specifically for the active noise reduction feature, so I do plan to have a battery in them at all times.  If I didn't want that feature then I would have just opted for a cheaper pair.I do like that carrying case these come with. It's not too large since they earpieces fold flat.  It has some room to store some extra batteries, and a fabric loop to hook onto your luggage when traveling.  I'm anxious to try these on my next commercial flight.I actually wanted the ANC9s to work out for me, since I thought they sounded good and were $100 cheaper at Best Buy.  But since I do plan to wear them for several hours each day, I went for the comfort.  I've tried various earbuds and on-the-ear headphones, but couldn't go more than an hour or two.  These fit completely around the ear, so all of the pressure is on your skill, (and I apparently have a thick one).  I can wear these all day, and I often do.Highly recommended!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Yes, I agree it is not apple to apple comparison. Compared QC 15 with Audio-Technica ATH-M50Build Quality:1) Audio Technica- Solid construction and very durable2) Bose- You pay $300 for an incredibly cheaply made.Size:1) Bose- They fit really well2) Audio-Technica- mid-sized.Comfort:1) Bose- Very comfortable. I did not experience too much discomfort.2) Audio-Technica- Exceeded my satisfaction though I felt more warmer on my ears compared to BoseSound:1) Audio-Technica- Mind blowing. Just beat the hell out of Bose. What a range!!2) Bose- Great sound, but missed highs and lows. For $300, I expected more.Noise cancellation:1) Audio-Technica- None available2) Bose- Excellent. Hardly hear anything other than people who are too loud.Overall, I love ATH-M50 more than QC 15. It is my feeling about the product."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are my primary air travel headphones, and let's just say they are great.  I use to wear in-ear earbuds to block out noise but after a couple of hours they felt like earwigs crawling into my ears, so enough was enough and I bought the Bose:The reason why I love these?1. The ultra soft leather on the cups doesn't push the arms on your glasses (if you wear glasses) into your brain while you are wearing these.  Some other headphones will do this, it seems Bose might have thought about this, especially for people who will wear these hours at a time.2. The iPod/iPad/iPhone volume control is actually useful, when the flight attendant comes along all you need is a simple push of the button and everything pauses so you can talk to her.3. Nice little pouch inside the case is perfect to store an extra battery in case you run out.4. They are comfortable to wear hours at a time.Everything about these headphones is premium, they feel much nicer than other noise-cancelling headsets I have tried. The sound is very balanced and warm, and by that I mean don't expect thundering bass or ear-cringing treble, everything seems to be in the right proportion and ""tight"".Some negatives?  The case is big, if you're travelling with only an overnighter bag, you'll have to be creative finding room for the case.  Keep in mind that the case does have a loop on top, so theoretically you could tie a sort of lanyard around the loop and wear the case around your neck while boarding.  Sure, little children will mock you and throw pacifiers at you if they see you wearing that thing around your neck, but take comfort in the fact that you'll be able to drown out their shrill little screams once you are on the plane, smiling at the thought that their parents are cursing you for finding noise-blocking peace."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,After owning one for about a year the plastic deformed enough that you cannot get the AAA battery out making it useless.  This is the second Bose product that I have bought that suffered from poor engineering.  Pretty much not buying from them anymore.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These things are awesome, I would have given them five stars except for one negative that is a real bummer, since I wanted these for the office: They leak too much sound!  I wanted closed headphones so I would not disturb my cubicle neighbors, and I have some Sennheiser studio headphones that are AWESOME as far as having very little sound leakage, but they don't sound as good to the user as these do!  I think I will need to keep the volume down, which is hard to do because they sound so good!  If you want them for home, traveling on airplanes, etc., they are perfect, albeit pricey."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is a review after 3 years of pretty constant use, including air travel, car travel, and just listening in my study.-The best part of these headphones is 100% the noise cancellation. It works wonders when traveling by air or car. This makes it easy to fall asleep in both situations. Ive had Audio Technicas and a cheap pair of Sony noise cancellation headphones before and both were nothing compared to these wonders. The noise cancellation works both ways too so even if you have the volume up, the person sitting next to you wont hear a thing. Its pretty amazing to take them off after a while and the amount of noise sounds like a blast compared to the sanctuary you were just experiencing.-The sound quality for the first 2 years is pretty amazing. It is very crisp and all frequencies are represented quite well. The bass could be more influenced, but thats what equalizers are for. Most individual instruments were distinguishable. This is in stark contrast to the Audio Technicas I had before.I am writing this review now because the sound quality has finally given out. It is immediately noticeable that the speakers have given out to wear and tear when compared to a brand new pair. The lower bass tones are almost completely gone.  For how much I've used them though, this seems reasonable. However, $300 is a LOT to plop down on a set of headphones any day.-The leather ear pads and head band are pretty durable, but are finally collapsing after 3 years of use. However, they are fairly easily replaceable. These are probably the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. They are very lightweight, its fairly easy to sleep with them on, and the ear pads feel like two baby kittens are sitting on your ears. Its quite nice. The carrying case is really good so if you keep them in it there should not be any problem with the plastic on the ear cups.-I originally had a gold-plated 2.5mm headphone jack, but it got sucked up by a vacuum and now I have a silver-plated one. I wouldnt say the difference is incredibly noticeable unless you are really into the high frequencies for some reason.-One major downside compared to other $300+ headphones is the lack of a rechargeable battery. It gets pretty annoying having to buy AAA batteries all the time. Each AAA battery only lasts about 10 hours so if you really listen to music a lot, you'll be buying AAAs each week.-These are not audiophile headphones, but they are for every person that travels and listens to music for purely pleasure and doesn't criticize it too much.- 4 stars because Im buying a different pair of headphones now that these have finally given out."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love how they did NOT hard wire the cord into the headphones. I did not realize I'd belted the cord into my airplane seat so somehow I managed to pull the cord out of the headphones. Much better than stressing it. Love how they nearly eliminate airplane noise but I was disappointed how vocal frequencies were easily discernible yet not intelligible. So, true noise is virtually eliminated but not all sound as I would prefer."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've owned two other sets of noise cancelling headphones before this, JVC and Sony. Overall I was happy with them. I left the JVC's on a plane 5 years ago, and broke the Sony's recently by being in a hurry. So, without too much hesitation I ordered a pair of QC-15's. I fly weekly and they seem to be ubiquitous among frequent fliers, as 7 times out of 10 if a person's wearing headphones on a plane they're QC-15's.I was in for a big surprise.  From the instant I put them on, and listened to the first track I sensed something big was missing.There was bass and treble, but I felt the mid-range sounded thin, hollow, lifeless. I listened to a dozen or so tracks from my iTunes library and felt the same on each. A food analogy - Imagine cutting open a melon and finding all the meat was scooped out, leaving just the bit before the rind.The QC-15's made my ears sweat from the second I put them on for some reason.I did a little more research and read a number of reviews on Amazon and on other audio websites. For the same price, I purchased a set of Polk Audio ULTRA FOCUS 8000 On-Ear Headphones. The difference is night and day! They're probably the best headphones I've owned. With these I hear fine nuances never before heard on every single track! They're well balanced with sufficient bass and treble and a big FAT mid-range.http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-ULTRA-FOCUS-8000/dp/B0080OHGZA/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1370724270&sr;=8-1-fkmr1&keywords;=polk+audio+ultrafit+8000The QC-15's do have better noise cancelling, but in the end I felt like I had a $300 pair of NC headphones with the sound of a $15 set of department store phones (worse maybe). The sound quality of the Polk's is far superior even if more external noise does get through. Note the Polk 'on-ear' term is misleading, as they actually surround the ear.I always say if I'm going to be a lemming, I want to know where I'm going and why. I was a bit of a lemming when I purchased the QC-15's. Don't be a lemming and settle for very sub-par $300 headphones when far superior sound quality is available at a similar price. If noise cancelling trumps all, then the QC-15's may be what you want, but if what you hear is more important than what you don't hear, check out other brands, including the Polk Audio 8000's."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I travel on a plane for work quite often.  I put these headphones on and leave them on even if I am not listening to music.  They are amazing.  The only thing I don't like is sleeping with these on.  If you lean the headphones against the seat or window on the plane they make a strange buzzing sound.  Otherwise they are great.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I was looking for a pair of headphones that provided superior noise cancellation, so that I could eat out at some of the restaurants at the local Galleria mall, where the clientele are busy and noisily chatting, making it hard to hear anything. These Bose headphones provide a comfortable easy fitting solution. They provide an amazing noise cancellation (so much so, that you won't be able to hear your waiter unless you take them off), with almost no bleeding of sound to disturb those around when you find yourself in quietier settings (at work, for example). The noise cancellation requires two AA batteries inserted into the left earphone, which you then switch on to initiate noise cancellation. In the other earphone, a connector plugs in, which enables you to listen to another device. It comes with two connectors, one for standard devices, and another which is specifically tailored to Apple products, and plugs into iPhones, iPads, iPods. The great feature of the Apple connector is that it comes with volume control switches, which essentially take over the volume control, enabling you more freedom. I was particularly pleased that it enables you to answer phone calls on your iPhone without worrying about the noisy surroundings in a restaurant or mall or stadium, a big advantage as far as I'm concerned. The main drawback is the cost, about $300. But I feel that for my purposes, it was money well spent.I must add that I haven't tried any of the other noise cancellation brands.PROS--Comfortable around the ears, easily stored in car compartment, easy to operate, light weight, special Apple connector for iPod/iPhone, outstanding noise cancellation, almost no bleeding of sound.CON--Cost.Strongly recommended."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I have tried a number of headphones from top brands and all of them are lying idle in my cupboard as most of them are unable to give the desired effect especially in a wide range of frequencies. It is at this point of time I heard about the QuietComfort noise canceling headphones from Bose. I know that Bose is the leading manufacturer of sound systems and are in the elite category.I realized that quality comes at a price and ordered the headphones. I would say that it is the best headphones I have had so far. Especially while on travel I find the whole world shut out once I put on my headphones. The experience is mind-blowing. Absolutely no distortion.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The headphones are amazing. I compared them to the similar priced Sennheiser and Beats headphones. By far these are the better headphones. The in-store demo units at Best Buy really demonstrate the audio quality and noise canceling. The headphones are light on your head, the aduio quality is amazing, the noise canceling is the best I've ever experienced (or not experienced), and the built in ipod remote in the cable is great. You will hear additional details in the music you never heard before. You can really pick out the instruments and vocals. The sound has depth and unlike most headphones they make me feel like I am in a front row of a concert just for me. Some/most headphones just blast the music out at your where you don't get that depth where if it feels like the sound is coming feet away rather than an inch or two to your ear. These headphones are great, but if you like rap or music with insane amount of bass you may want to get Beats. The bass is great on the Bose, but if all your music is Boom Boom Pow and Rap then you may want to opt for that tiny 8% better bass for that kind of music. I'm not saying the bass is bad on these. I listen to Boom Boom Pow, but I also love country, top 40, rock, rap, r&b;, alternative, audio books, j-pop, and more. Try listening to a song like ""Everywhere"" by Fleetwood Mac and not smile at the quality and depth. I like a little bit of rap and these are fine. Boom Boom Pow sounded amazing. I know, I've actually seen Black Eyed Peas in concert and the song sounded exactly like the concert except for the screaming since it was not the live version of the song. The control on the cable is very handle for anyone with an ipod (1st and 2nd gen may not work with the ipod controls on some versions of the ipods). I can adjust the volume, skip songs, fast forward, rewind, play, and pause with controls. I never have to turn on my ipod touch screen (I always play random). That is a huge selling point since I listen to music every night to relax to that very point you will fall asleep within a minute. The case is very sturdy and feels sturdy enough to protect the bose headphones against nearly anything except sitting on it. The leather on the headphones is soft and genuine and it feels amazing on your head. The ear cups are so soft and comfortable you almost forget your wearing headphones. The noise cancelling at home drowns out my sister if she is more than 10 feet away and my 2 bedroom fans are completely quiet. My room is right next to the attic fan and it virtually drowns it out to next to nothing. The headphones are very stylish with the black on chrome look.Now, the cons. Price. I've known for a while that Bose is the king of headphones imo. These are actually the first Bose headphones I've ever bought. I've kind of had this as my headphone history. Ipod headphones (no bass) -> $6 walmart special ear buds -> $15 aiwa over hear headphones -> sennheiser cx300 (first quality ear buds) -> able planet 1000 series noise cancelling (300 new 55 on ebay since no one knows about them) -> bose qc 15s. I was happy with the able planets since I tested them out at the airport and they blew my sennheiser cx300's out of the water and they were the first noise cancelling headphones I've ever had. I still love them. However, my Dad did something to me. We were early to the theater and went to Best Buy to kill 30 minutes. I saw the Bose booth and tried them out. I just wanted to know how they compared. I tried them out and it was the next level. Sound wise it was only like 9-12% better. Barely a big improvement. Where it was better was the comfort, the audio depth (feeling like your in a concert), and the near complete silence. I heard nothing in Best Buy with the Bose. I hear nothing in my room. My able planets I could hear 20% of the fan noise, but it was less than a whisper. I'm a gadget nut so I had to have them. $300 is a crazy amount of money. So I went to ebay for them. After three days of trying I finally found a like new pair of Bose QC 15s for $195 on ebay. Just a couple of surface scratches and it was the first batch they released in 2010 that did not come with the ipod cable. Oh well on the cable, my ipod touch has volume controls and my able planets did not have it. I ended up finding a $6 ilove adapter that adds the ipod remote to any headphone and I thought I was good. The headphones came in and they were flawed. The sound quality was really good. However, whenever music was not playing I had a hum on the left headphone. I re-seated the cables, swaped batteries, and even borrowed my Dad's ipod and it did not fix it. Now, you think it is not a huge problem. Just listen to music. However, some music have tiny little parts of silence and that will get annoying quick. What I ended up having to do was call Bose and they helped me. It looks like the first batch of Bose headphones do not have a serial number, so unless you kept your box you will have to pay for the repair. They don't actually repair. The offer a $100 trade in option where you can get a new set or the new set of the newest model. Long story short. DON'T BUY USED! I know they are probably pretty rugged, but I am treating these like babies and I will not bring them with me on the plane. Not only because I am worried about them and possibly paying $100 again, but because of space. I am getting into digital photography with slr cameras. I have this case logic bag I am bringing with me so I can listen to music, use my ipad, slr equipment, and a person item or two. In order for it to fit in this bag, I have to have headphones that fit in a space about the size of a can of pop (len's compartment). They had a sale on Amazon a few weeks ago on the 2011 model white Able Planet noise cancelling headphones that fold up and they were $40. I will be using those for vacations. The able planets are amazing. However, I am a bit of a audiophile and I want the Bose at home.I highly recommend these headphones if you have the $300. The noise cancelling, audio quality, and comfort are incredible. By far the depth (concert like sound) and noise cancelling sold me. You will be very happy with these. Anyone who really loves music and travels frequently should buy these. Now, if you are find with giving up 20-25% of the noise cancelling, some depth, and audio quality that is basically within 1/4"" of $300 headphones I would look at the able planets. When I was traveling last March they had those headphones at the airport stores to try. Save yourself some money. Look online and get those able planets used or on sale. My first pair had a msrp of $300 and I got it for $55 on ebay. No one single counter bid since they are not as famous as Bose. If you need foldable get the new white pair for $40-$50 and it sounds 95% as good as my higher quality Able Planet. I'd highly recommend the foldable one for teenagers or anyone who does not travel often and wants a great quality noise canceling headphone on the plane. Just know that besides for the sennheiser cx300's, I have not used the Able Planets or Bose on the plane. I can't comment on that. I know the Bose works great on the plane. If my 80's attic fan is virtually drowned out to a whisper with my able planets than the plane noise should be nearly drowned out to a whisper."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I just bought this headphones and I was expecting something real extraordinary after I was using Able Planet Headphones (Clear Harmony 1100B) which are here in Amazon around $110.00, and guess what? There is no real difference between Able Planet and Bose only in the price ($299 Vs $110).So, my comment is that Bose is now more the branding than the product, at the end all these products are made in China.Something real cool from Able Planet Headphones is that you can use them with the power switch off but with Bose you can't, which means that if your battery dies during a trip, you won't have more music.If you are looking for crisp and clear audio sound and great sound isolation you may have other options as good as Bose, so think about it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've been using my QC2's for a few years and love them to bits, the problem is so does my wife. So, to avoid having to choose between them I got a pair of QC15's for our most recent trip, and was even more impressed. I didn't find any dis-improvements but found 3 significant improvements. 1) I'd say the QC2's cut out approx 80% of airplane noise, with the QC15's it's up to about 95%, the improvement really is that significant when trying one pair on after the other. Having shared my last 2 flights with loud, listen to me Stanford voices droning on for 6 hours solid about their Amazing tech jobs, only the Bose's have prevented in-flight bloodshed. 2) The space for your ear is bigger and more comfortable, you can see the difference best by comparing the mouldings in the case that the earphones sit over. 3) The QC15s come with 2 cables, one is Bose's standard cable, the other has an inline remote control for your iPhone/iPod/iPad (4 & 4S only I think), it has superb ergonomics, volume +/- and play/pause, also a mic I believe but don't take my word for that, it also works fine in the QC2s if you want to accessorize the old things. In short, we're both very happy I got these, and if I ever get to use them again I will be a happy bunny."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel a lot, not just planes, trains and cars but offen staying in hotels and others places that are not quiet.  I'm also an insomniac.  Well I decided after reviews and other info to bite the bullet and spend the money to try these headphones.  First, you do use a small battery so when worn, this activates the white noise so I can sleep peacefully anywhere.  I plugged them into my Kindle to listen to books and its so wonderful, I can't believe how much I have missed as I'm also a little hard of hearing. Of course movies and music on planes is so much better.  I wear glasses but these headphones seal right around them.  Would I buy again?  In a heartbeat yes.  Worth the cost?  Yes.  Nothing is made to last forever but if they give me a year or two before needing to be replaced will still be worth the cost."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"After we moved to Hawaii, long flights became routine. I know I didn't really have to mention Hawaii but what's the point of living in Hawaii if you can't constantly throw it in everyone's face? These headphones are the greatest things ever. You have no idea how loud a plane is until you wear these for a few hours and then remove them. 4 stars only because they create some weird pressure on my eardrums. Other than that they are great for long flights to Hawaii, where I live."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I hesitated buying these as I wasn't sure how good they would be, but they are perfect for traveling or just jamming quietly at home, or just to tune everything out. Noise canceling is great, as is the sound quality."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these for my son for Christmas because he wanted some quality, noise-cancelling headphones that would work for music as well as gaming.  I chose these because the price is not vastly more than other brands but the reputation of Bose lead me to expect better.  I'd previously owned noise-cancelling Sony headphones and was sorely disappointed.  They worked great for about 3 months, then quit working in the noise-cancelling department on one headphone.  I inquired about a warrantee repair but after 90 days it had expired.  3 months into these Bose headphones and my son is thrilled.  He uses the noise-cancelling constantly while watching movies on his ipod and while gaming online and, frankly, it works wonders because I have to remove the earpiece from his ear in order to get his attention.  And no, he doesn't have the sound cranked up loud.  It uses some batteries but the sound quality is excellent - best I've ever heard from any headphones and far better than the Beats headphones at a similar cost."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Awesome, anyways it is from Bose. This is a gift to my son and he is loving it. It does not play music but feels it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,My best friend on an airplane - which I am on frequently!  Great sound - great noise reduction.  Tried the Sony version and was very disappointed.  These are great!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My snobbery was based on the Bose FAQ (here [...] However, this is a fine piece of equipment. I primarily bought this for listening while on public transportation and when flying to reduce my headaches ( the monotonous droning sound of the engines, theorize in part). It is expensive, but well worth it. World of a difference between this and those piddly ear buds when you are on a noisy train or bus. Saves your hearing a bit by giving you the ability to keep the volume down versus the non-noise canceling ones.This equipment however does not change my opinion about their speakers and other electronic equipment."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am a Bose fan, and have been for over 15 years.  From the moment I heard the sound reproduction and noise cancellation quality of the QC15 headset in a local store, I was hooked.  I went out and bought myself a set the next week and have had them now for over 5 years.  So here are the pros and cons:PROs- Excellent active noise cancellation*- Excellent battery life despite the fact that sound from audio sources can only be heard when the headset is turned on- Interchangeable cord feature; multiple audio cords are available and can be swapped out within a few seconds- Comes with a quality carrying case to protect the headsets while traveling or when not in use- Included accessories are an airport audio headset adapter and legacy 1/4&#34; jackCONs- Retail price ($299) has not changed since their release several years ago - there are now several companies that produce headphones of equal performance for less money- Can only listen to a source when the headphones are turned on - not capable of passive sound reproduction- *Active noise cancellation seems to be limited to lower end frequencies which is excellent in elminating most subtle background noises and aircraft engine hum.  Unfortunately, you can still hear people talking - I wish Bose would come out with an updated version that also eliminates the human voice...maybe add a second active noise cancellation switch for filtering out voices?Other thoughts:  I already own one pair of Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones and just recently ordered a second set for my work place.  I decided early on that I did not want to buy another brand new QC15 headset as they are very expensive.  So, I decided to buy a used pair instead from the Amazon marketplace.  Much to my surprise, I received the headsets and they worked perfectly.  There are a few minor wear and tear marks on the outside plastic shells of the ear pieces (as was stated in the item description before I bought them), but the wear was from normal use and is not very noticeable.  The headsets themselves work perfectly and on par with my other QC15 headset I bought new a few years ago.  I am very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend those interested in looking for an excellent active noise cancelling headset but are on a limited budget to consider buying a used QC15 headset - well worth the money!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The good:1. Sound Quality - the sound quality on this is really good. I'm not an audiophile, but these are the best sounding headphones i've owned. the bass is good and the notes are crisp.2. Comfort - They are comfortable for about two or three hours of continuous use. After that, the noise cancellation just gives you a headache.The bad:1. They run on 1 AAA battery, so if you forget to turn them off , they drain fast.  Expect the battery to last about a week with about 2-3 hours of use daily.2. There is no way to turn off the noise cancellation, also they don't work if the battery dies, so remember to keep a battery handy.Undecided:I haven't owned any other noise cancellation headphones, so cannot compare the noise cancellation with other headphones, but i've listened to them with the tv on and they do a decent job of cutting out the background noise."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've been owning this headphone for about 3 years and wanted to chip in my opinion as well.I'm a big headed audiophile, so headphone sizes and comfort matter a lot to me.1. comfortFor big heads, Dr.Dre headphones are no go and that refers to Studio level headphones. I tried them, and putting music quality aside, it was aching my head after a few minutes of listening and I was very afraid of breaking its headband.3 years of usage, bose qc15 never betrayed me. Very sturdy and flexible headphone. My head never hurts and very comfortable (although if you listen to it for a long time, you will eventually get tired...)2. noise cancellingbose always advertises their headphones in front of a kiosk with a loud plane sounded speakers. They are confident that their headphones work and they meant it. Now let's not put the expectation way too high. It won't block everything 100% as if you're in space. You will still be able to hear some stuff outside, but it completely blocks certain types of sounds (plane engine sounds in particular) and you will be very comfortable listening to your music only, fully silencing outside sound.Three years of usage and I can still guarantee that this thing's worth every single penny."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these headphones for work. I sit in an open environment with help desk people just a few feet away from me. They are very distracting and sometimes overly loud. I'm not really a music listener, but I have used some bluetooth headphones to try and dim the noise, however the music can also be distracting.I tried these headphones on a flight before I bought them. The noise reduction is outstanding. When you turn them on, only the higher pitch noises can be heard, everything at a lower level is instantly muted. You can still hear voices if they are very close to you, but on the whole you are sitting in near silence.I bought these headphones direct from Bose because they have a 12 month payment plan. They arrived earlier this week. The build quality certainly doesn't seem to warrant the $300 price tag. They are plasticy and have faux leather. They are still made sturdier than your typical $30 headphone set, but I would have liked to see more aluminum or lighweight metal. My first problem was thay I put the battery in upside down. The door to the battery compartment then jammed and I had to poke something into the crack to get it to re-open. The battery door is very cheaply made.I did not connect the cords as I intend these for providing silence only. When activated, these headphones block almost everything out. You cannot hear low pitch noises at all, and only the clacking of your keyboard will come through. Other people's voices are distant or severely muted - which is wonderful. I know that our secretary is chatting with a co-worker right now, but it's so faint that I don't care. I cannot hear the help desk at all. You don't appreciate how much noise an A/C system makes until you turn these headphones on.I used re-chargeable LiIon batteries to power the headphones and the first battery has lasted 3 days. The battery just started to flash a 5 hour warning to say that it's almost out.On the whole I would say that these are terribly overpriced if you intend to use them as just headphones, but if you are easily distracted or fly frequently, then I would say that they are worth the price.Bose needs to improve on the materials that they use. For the money that they charge, the headphones should be made to last a decade or more."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tried the audia-technica headphones and I can report that the sound quality is not nearly as good and the noise cancelling was lacking as well. Also for someone with a large head those headphones were exceedingly uncomfortable.Enter the Bose headphones. Very comfortable to wear, excellent noise cancelling and great overall sound quality. I can work a chainsaw and listen to a podcast with moderate volume.These headphones are not durable if your an active person such as myself. If you want them for plane rides or commutes I suspect they will work fine and last for awhileNear the connector the plastic started to strip bare after only a few weeks. I've had to wrap it in electrical tape.I dropped these about 2 feet onto a concrete sidewalk and the ear cup completely separated from the headphones forcing me to attempt a fix with gorilla glue to my now, unusable $300 headphones.This is a drop my 10 year old Sennheiser HD-280s could have made 100 times in a row due to superior durability of that product. In fact I am wearing those right now and, despite their age, the performance is superb.Hopefully my glue fix will work for the Bowes headphones, because I enjoy the noise cancelling aspects. My next step will be to try Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones if I am forced to abandon my Bowes."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Coworkers may be loud, but it really doesn't matter when I'm wearing these. More productive hours have been had in quiet lately."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Sound quality is excellent, cancels probably 90-95% of sound.  Comfortable and easy to wear even for a 12 year old.No problems so far with durability.Recommended."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had a Bose QC 3 that I got as a used item. That was simply awesome. I gave that to my dad and was looking out for a new noise cancelling phone. Got a new synnheiser. Synnheiser was ok but certainly could not match a Bose. In the bose that I got as used I used to hear my old song collection in a new different way and lot of low frequency music was easily and noticably reproduced in Bose. Quite disappointed with Synnheiser I was packing it for returns. I ordered this Bose QC Comfort 15 so that it arrives before I could return Synn. Had few hours of parallel testing and Bose was a clear winner. Although Bose loses on the fact that its not a bluetooth enabled headphone, but for the difference between the prices I can easily get a Bose + bluetooth headset and still cost lesser than synnheiser. Bose is wonderful even as a used item, Synnheisser is bad even as a new item."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have traveled internationally for work for the past 2 years which includes flights on very noisy small planes as well as 12-13 hour flights on the giant ones. I desperately tried not to spend the money on these Bose and tried Denon, Ludacris, Sony, and a few other brands of noise-canceling headphones. I couldn't wear any of them for very long because of the discomfort and although the noise cancellation was good, none of them can compare to the Bose. I thought all the frequent travelers had them just because they were Bose... now I know they all have them because they are far and away the best. The sound is awesome (see some of the more technical reviews for details on that), the soundless-ness is awesome (trust me!), and I have worn them and slept in them for entire 8+ hour flights. If you travel, don't waste your time trying to spend less on something else. These are worth every single penny!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"When you first don these headphones you may find them to be so comfortable - with the buttery leather hugging your head sensuously - that you don't care much how they sound.  It's a feeling that strikes me every time.  Turn the music on, and you will hear rich, clear sound.  It's not been since the nineteen seventies that I've seriously listened to sound through headphones, so I cannot tell whether these headphones compare well to other good phones.  What I do notice is that I hear noises in recordings I've listened to for decades through my DCM time windows speakers that I have never heard before.  My impression is that the sound is a little more colored with these than with my speakers, but it's not an unpleasant difference.  In short, I think the sound will satisfy all but the most demanding audiophiles.A great feature is that the earphones work to limit noise reaching your ears even when they are turned off.  Turn them on, and the effect is better.  Listen to music, and even  irritating noises can disappear into the background.  Again, I have not compared these to other noise canceling head phones, but I would characterize them as being pretty effective.Bose has made some design decisions that have proven to be very inconvenient to me.  I use the headphones at my desk when I work on my computer.  This means that it would be much more convenient  if they were powered through the USB cable.  But they're not.  They use triple-A batteries. A lot of triple A batteries - even though they use just one at a time. When the battery begins to get low it will work for a second or two.  Then the earphones will make a loud Pfft! noise that can be heard across the room.  Then silence.  Then, after a couple seconds the system works again for a second or two. And the Pfft!. And so on.  It's so irritating that being forced to listen to this for some time could be characterized as torture under the Geneva Convention. Ironic behavior for a device whose very purpose is to isolate us from sources of sonic discomfort; don't you think?There's another serious problem with the battery.  It's small.  And these headphones never sleep. Forget to turn off the headphones overnight, and you need to put in a new battery.  Listen for a few hours, and you need to put in another battery.  It seems that every time I pick up my headphones I need to put in another battery.  If you buy these headphones you must do one of three things:  either buy the giant boxes of triple A batteries offered at Costco or other wholesale markets, or buy a handful of rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  Or buy lots of shares in a battery manufacturing company of your choice, and write a favorable review of these headphones here.  Whichever you choose, consider it just a cost of using these headphones.  Otherwise you are likely to find yourself constantly out of triple-A batteries, and none of the reasons for spending this much on  good headphones will matter."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"They do an awesome job at noise cancelling.  By noise cancelling, they don&#8217;t just mean passive means of thick padded cups muffling the outside noise &#8211; they mean there are small microphones on the outside and inside of the headset, and using a small battery in the headphones, they actually create a negative sound wave to cancel out the outside sounds.  Result:  does I would call a 100% and sort of &#8220;magic trick&#8221; job at completely cancelling out low end sounds: fan noise, dryer noise, noise of air through heating ducts, traffic going by the house, doors opening and closing.  Does a 80-90% job to cancel out voices: basically you can hear voices still a lot, but because all of the low end is removed from the voice, you hear only a very low volume tinny remnant of the voices around you.  So if your MAIN purpose of buying them is to cut out voices very near around you within just a few feet, know that it does NOT remove 100% of very nearby talkers.All that is just putting on the headset, without even using the cord.  The cord actually can be removed from the phone so you don&#8217;t have to have a dangling wire when you are only using it for noise cancelling.  Flip the switch from OFF to ON, while wearing the headset, and you can hear it go from passive noise cancelling (just due to the pads and cups of the headphone), to active circuitry negating the outside sounds.I remember the first time I donned these, was on a American Airlines flight.  I was sitting in first class, and American Airlines planes are very old, so they don&#8217;t have a separate TV screen for every chair (like a lot of other airlines do &#8211; many like Jet Blue every seat on the plane has its own personal TV that you can watch any movie or whatever separately from your neighbor).  Anyway, since American doesn&#8217;t have individual movie screens, they gave everyone in first class an iPad, and a pair of these Bose headphones.I put them on, and holy crap!  ALL of the plane engine noise disappeared - so much so, that I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing (wasn&#8217;t hearing really).  I didn&#8217;t realize it was using active noise cancelling, I just figured these were the best set of foam padding headphones in the world by design!  I remembered them a month ago around Christmas time when my house was full of my family being home, and after a few days of not getting anything work done while working at home (luckily I don't take phone calls, but work at my computer all day long), I ordered them.It comes with two included snap-in cords: one regular (left/right audio, 3 pin 1/8 inch mini), and one made for iPhones, iPads, and other devices, and another cord - 1/8 inch mini with 4 contacts on the barrel,  that you can use with your iPhone or whatever as a headset with a microphone.  Yes, it will use the microphone that is built into the headset for noise cancelling as a standard audio microphone if you use the second cord.  There's also an inline controller on the cord so you can do volume UP, volume DOWN, and MUTE.  When you start to listen to anything, it drowns out the outside sound even more &#8211; just by diverting your attention I suspect, and the fact that you can play the music so LOW in volume to work, while outside sounds are removed, plain and simply said &#8211; it is a really cool experience for doing quiet concentrative work.I&#8217;ve been wearing them while working every day at home, even now that the wife and daughter are back to work and school, and I am the only one home, I still prefer to wear them to be productive!Sure, maybe if ALL you want is 100% noise cancelling, being around construction, or whatever, maybe a $1.99 set of foam ear plugs, that you roll in your finger to make them small, and let them expand in your ear and block out nearly all the sound, MIGHT be better (I want to do that test to compare as I am interested to see).  But I am totally happy with them, and will never FLY again without bringing them so I can have a super quiet flying experience on any airline, and will now just see how long it takes to burn out the single AA battery with enjoyment all the way!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I didn't realize, how good is the NC of these headphones until I finished trying all the other options available (upto 500$).I am using it for 8 months now and these are the most comfortable headphones I have ever tried with the great sound and a great great NC."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones surpass any other headphones I have or have tried Superb Noise cancellation,  excellent frequency response. ---As one other reviewer put it "" BLISSFUL SERENITY"" .  As I see it, with reasonable  care, there should be no breakage problems and they should last a very long time."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had these for a year and liked them at first. But over time I noticed that my eardrums sometimes hurt from the active noise cancelling, but there was no way to turn it off without still getting audio. I just couldn't use these anymore for regular music listening.I went with the Sennheiser PXC 450, and think they are superior to the Bose."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I use it at work and when I travel. This and my kindle are my best friends when i hop on a plane.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Noise-canceling function of these phones is the best around at this price point, if you read online review sites. Over-ear cups fit great, even over my freakish, giant ears. Very light and comfortable. Battery use seems minimal; I haven't had to replace it yet. Most important, hey sound great! Worth the price.Other notes:I use in conjunction with an Inada Sogno massage chair, and I can wear these comfortably while my head is in the neck/shoulder unit of that chair."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I debated for months on which of the expensive, sound cancelling headphones, should I go with the Beats by Dr. Dre, Sennheiser or the Bose. I determined that for my taste (it is critical that you determine this prior to entering your &#34;shopping&#34; mode as it each offer drastically difference experiences depending on how you like to listen to your music) that the Bose QC15 headphones were it for me. I appreciated the bass that the Beats had, but I'm not a head bopper, not really a fan of rap since I like music with real lyrics and you know, people with real talents so I determined these might not be the fit. I also did not like that they felt like they could break easily.....as a matter of fact, of the various stores I went to look at them (Best Buy, Apple Store, Target) many of the models were actually broken.....surely that can be both attributed to faulty manufacturing as much as moronic teenagers playing around with expensive toys. I didn't like anything about the Sennheiser so I won't elaborate further on that model. By the time I got to the Bose store I was basically pleading in my head for these to be it and I'm so glad I saved these for last because it made me appreciate everything the other two were not to me. I liked the design much better, sleek but classy, the bass and treble are much more balanced providing a nicer listening experience. I tried it with every genre I could find in my library, hip/hop, jazz, folk, alternative, dance music, and the lyrics were much clearer to me. Also, I want to point out, I travel for a living so the &#34;sound canceling&#34; part of these headphones was critical. I'm pleased to say that when they're on the world really is tuned completely out to you which is amazing when you have a screaming kid (or 10) on your plane.Comfort was important to me as well and I like that I can wear them on 11 hour flights without hesitation, without having my ears feel irritated by the material, etc.I do have to note, this is my second pair (thank God for my square trade warranty) because one of the cuffs broke off after much wear and tear which happened after 3 years of wearing on my big noggin' (no surprise it happened really) but with my 2nd pair came two options of cables to plug in to the devices you'll be using. The traditional option and an option which comes with a volume control and speaker for Apple products so that was a nice bonus.In all, I have about a million positive things to say about them but I don't want to bore you all with them, just know, it's the best $300 I spent!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,What a wonderful headphone . I trust of Bose . but I recommend you don't use it when you drive . because will not hear the others cars .
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"There's a lot of talk regarding these lately and how they match up to the beats. I've owned or used a pair of most types of Beats by Dre. Generally, I'm pretty positive on the sound quality of the Beats Studios and I proudly owned them for a bit. I had the matte silver ones so they looked a little less flashy for more conservative environments. Recently, however, I made the switch after a long and drawn out internal debate. I do not regret switching to the QC 15s, and I'll go into some detail why.I'm 32 and an academic, and I have had this difficult time getting past the feeling that I'm too old for Beats. They are, after all, very much geared toward a younger 24 and under crowd. Bose, in my opinion, is not just more mature, but I believe they are a brand that crosses all age groups. Bose is a brand of sophistication, not really bold fashion; sophistication can look amazing too, and these do.Between the Bose and the Studios, I can most honestly say that I cannot tell a lot of difference in the bass except for the Bose sounding a bit more clean. These reviewers stating that the QC 15's have no bass I can't help but think they got a defective pair. I listen to many, many different types of music ranging from dubstep, ambient, and symphony and I believe that Bose offers the all around best and most accurate bass. Combine that with the clearer acoustics, percussion, and everything else you could possibly think of and you have a significantly better sound. As for how they sound in hip hop...I can't stand hip hop, but I have listened to it for the purposes of comparison. Bose still sound better, and there's more than enough bass to satisfy the biggest rap nut.As for appearance, I stress that Beats create a look for fashion, and Bose go for a look of sophistication. Beats seem to be best worn around the neck as far as I can tell. Like I said, they are a fashion accessory. Bose QC 15s are meant to be truly worn, and when you put these things on you feel...well, sophisticated. They look extremely classy.Lets discuss the feel for a moment. Beats Studios, I'll admit, feel great. I have absolutely nothing bad to say on their comfort. Bose QC 15's are significantly lighter, and the ear cushions envelop the entire ear a bit more spaciously than the Studios.  Also, I don't believe the hold in as much heat in the ear cushions as they Studios, but neither one is extraordinarily hot. Also, I wear glasses, so sometimes ear fatigue can be a problem with headphones in general. Neither the Studios or QC 15s caused me any issues, but I was much more prone to forgetting I even had the QC 15s on. They just feel so incredibly light, and part of that is they are made of high grade plastic. Regardless of what you might hear or read, I feel these things are very, very sturdy. The Studios always felt like their folding hinge was going to be a problem at any given time.Noise cancellation? QC 15s have no equal, and the Studios are a joke in comparison. The QC 15s will put you in your own world with your music, and with perfect clarity. The noise cancellation in the Studios creates a low volume static white noise that is very noticeable when listening to lower volume music, especially orchestral symphony and ambient. QC 15s are almost magical. I will forever be shocked by these. Oh and by the way, don't trust the quality exactly from the demo units you see in chain retail stores. Your actual pair sound significantly better, especially the noise cancellation.I won't go any further for fear of droning on, but I will say this: I would buy the QC 15's many times over than get another set of Beats or even Beats Studios. They sound better, the noise cancellation is unrivaled, and their sophisticated appearance are difficult to ""beat."""
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are priceless if you fly a lot; never again will I have to hear the sound of those demonic babies screaming for hours on end. If you fly, you need these, and you will love them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I put them on my girlfriend and she was rocking for hours. They are really fanastic, worth every penny. Buy it"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Forget Beats by Dr. Dre, no matter how hyped up they are.Nothing beats these headphones. From their sound quality to unsurpassed noise cancellation... From their comfort to their battery life... I am a Bose QC QuietComfort guy for as long as they exist.The extra cable that can open iTunes on Apple devices, control their volume while providing a built-in mic is an excellent perk. Especially if you do a lot of videoconferencing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Better than my Audiovon or Beats by Dr. Dre, these are the best at reproducing sound and cancelling out noise."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The QC15 has an amazing abulity to block out virtually all sorts of ambient, continuous noises (airplane drone, street noise, office hubub, A/C blowing), AND reproduce quality sound so you don't have to sacrifice one for the other when needed.The QC15 is built well-enough, but would not be considered rugged in the least. You have to be careful with it--don't expect to leave it lying around or hooked around your neck or shoulder for periods of time when not in use. It probably needs to be kept in its case.I used my QC15 recently on a long flight from the States to Southeast Asia, aboard a Singapore Airlines Airbus A380. I had some issues using my QC15 with the in-flight entertainment system. There was a constant buzzing sound that made it impossible to use on movies. I had my backup Audio Technica ANC23 Noise-Cancelling earbuds, and did not have this problem (I had to fiddle with the in-line volume control by bumping up the volume on the ANC23 and turning down the master volume on the in-flight system. The ANC23 does not have nearly as good noise cancellation as the QC15, but in this particular instance, it won out. Too bad the in-linw controls for the QC15 is only for iPod use. I switched out the battery and used a different airline adapter--same problem. However, when I used the QC15 with my iPod, no issues whatsover--the sound was pristine clear minus all ambient noise. Unbelievable.Had the same issues on the return flight, so I am not sure whether it is the plane, the entertainemtn system, an incompatibility with the QC15, or a combination of the three. Just be aware there may be some issues with using the QC15 on some in-flight systems, and it is not a deficiency in the headphones per se, since it works perfectly well in all other respects.Your best bet for the best combination of noise cancellation and quality sound."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"So BOSE is pretty much what I use for most of my audio, from my car to my 5.1 living room to my ear buds to my QC 15's, I really REALLY like BOSE stuff.  These phones are VERY good and worth the $.  I like the fact that if you break them (I did and that's mostly why I gave a 4 star rating as I am pretty careful with my stuff). I did travel a lot with these and figure that is why the headpiece eventually cracked, but would have appreciated a stronger frame.  Comfort is great, sound is BOSE and NC works as it should.  One of the upsides to owning BOSE equipment is the replacement cost.  When I did eventually crack my headset, the replacement for a brand new set was less than $100.00, which made the frustration manageable."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"As soon as I put these on without even having any audio coming through them I was hooked.  Drowns out everything.  And when you actually start playing something you realize why everyone loves these things.  If you can swing it, order them.  You won't regret it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I fly to Asia a lot, and these make a world of difference.  They are comfortable for long periods.  And, they really quite the noise of the plane letting me rest.  Totally worth it for me.  Oh yeah, they sound good too!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love the Bose QC15 head phones so much, I bought a second pair, one for home and travel, and one to leave at work. The first pair I bought nearly 3.5 years ago, and they still work as well as the day I bought them. I did have to replace the ear pads on the first pair a few months ago, but this is after using them nearly every day since I got them. You can order the ear pads directly from Bose for around $30 dollars. The case for these even has enough room to store a couple extra AAA batteries, and a small device (I store my Zune HD in it). The noise canceling on these is superb. I work in an open environment (no cubicles) so there can be a lot of conversations going on at once, and this allows me to stay focused for many hours of coding. It's also very good for use on long flights."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I don't know how I've gone so long without these! I travel on 40-50 flights a year and always struggle to relax. These blank out the world and only certain sounds can be heard at a low volume. They completely block out the droning sound of the airplane engines. When paired with music, you can't hear anything going on outside of the headphones.I'm buying another set for my wife."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"As a heavy business traveler, (planes, trains, and automobiles), I consider a good quality pair of noise cancellation headphones a necessity. My first pair of noise cancellation headphones were the old Bose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Canceling Headphones. I purchased them in 2004 and they never let me down. It was only after the battery pack started giving me trouble that I decided to upgrade to the newer Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones in 2013. The quality and functionality was night and day! Not that I was disappointed with the QC2 headphones, the flexibility, removal of the battery pack, and sound quality were far superior.However, I made that purchase just a few months before Bose released the in-ear Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. That didn't bother me too much, because I assumed that over the ear headphones would do a better job at blocking out ambient noise. And I was skeptical that an in-ear headphone could really be comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Again, I was very wrong. After a little contemplation and with Bose's 30 day money back guarantee, I decided to buy the QC20s to test and compare the two Bose products.Comfort:Like any over-the-ear headphone, there will be time where you will sweat after wearing it long periods of time. The QC15 is no exception. It is not as bad as some cheaper models from rivals, but an hour commute on the MTA and NJ Transit in the afternoon rush would easily and quickly make my head sweat. So there would be times where i would remove them just to breathe, which defeated the purpose of having noise cancellation headphones. But I must reiterate, this will happen with any over-the-ear headphones, not just Bose.The QC20 is an extremely comfortable in-ear headphone that eliminates any and all 'hot head' issues caused by the QC15. This is a huge advantage in my opinion. And though it took me a few wears to realize which size ear pieces (included in the box) fit my ear best, it is now an easy and perfect fit. I flew across the country last week on a 6 hour flight and never felt the need to take out the headphones to rest my ears or due to any discomfort. They were very relaxing and to a point became unnoticeable.Functionality:I have nothing bad to say about the quality and functionality of the QC15. Other reviewers have correctly mentioned that at times it feels like you listening underwater when you just have the noise cancellation engaged without music. However, when music is played through the headphones, all quirkiness goes away. And the noise cancellation is top notch innovation that you would expect from Bose.Regarding the QC20, I put it on an equal platform in terms of noise cancellation. However, the underwater hiss that many users of the QC15 speak about is not there for the QC20. But what is there is a big, ugly, inconvenient at times rechargable battery pack at the end of the headphones rear the plug-in connector. Bose, WHY??? Actually, I understand why. There has to be a place for the components to make the in-ear headphones function, but the size and placement of the pack reminds me of the old battery pack attached to the QC2 I owned over 10 years ago. Surely, Bose could have innovated a smaller pack or made the cord slightly longer so it wouldn't always get in the way of the device your are plugged into. But it is definitely not a deal breaker for me, just an annoyance.Bottom Line:Depending on your needs, the QC20 is not a functional upgrade from the QC15, but it is a better choice if you are comparing between purchasing one or the other. The quirks of the QC15 outweigh that of the QC20. The most notable being 'hot head'.The QC20 are ultra portable, convenient, great battery life from the rechargeable pack, and comfortable to wear. I suggest you give them a try knowing that Bose has a 30 day satisfaction guarantee."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love these headphones. I have traveled with them and the noise reduction is incredible.  I am very picky when it comes to ear comfort and I cannot use earplugs or buds of any type.  The shape and softness of the bose is nice but after an hour or so I start fidgeting with them as for my taste, I would prefer they cover an even bigger area of my ear, but I never expected perfection when it came to shape - I have large ears & lobes.I only wish this company would make a blue-tooth version for TV/PC use as fooling with a cord with is getting old.I use this on my PC when I want to watch a movie and I need to keep things quiet - works great here.I have traveled and used for watching a movie on a flight, although I don't like the pressure on my ears after about an hour. On a flight, the noise cancelling is top notch and worth the price.TIP:  Take extra batteries as I have left these on without realizing - the headphones will ""beep"" to let you know."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Paid $300 on bestbuy, and they lasted 3 months before the left earcup stopped working. Tried to contact Bose, but they won't help me since I don't have my receipt anylonger. So these are going in the garbagecan. First and last Bose product ever, stay far away from these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The new Bose headphones are awesome!!!They are everything that I was hoping for, and everything that I anticipated in an isolating headset.Great isolation. I can now listen to quiet music while other household members play theirs loudly. A blessing to be sure. I would definitely recommend them for anyone. Put my cheapie non-isolating headphones to shame."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Pros:* Great noise reduction, completely satisfies my need for isolation in noisy office.* Lightweight for its size.* Long cord.* Nice firm-shell carrying case.* Includes an iPhone cord with microphone.* Battery in earpiece (not in a separate clunky module).* Sound is good.  I'm no audiophile, and my hearing isn't that great, but evenI can tell there's a huge improvement compared to earbuds.  I can understand conversations a lot more easily.Cons:* The iPhone cord microphone is in the wrong place (it's up by your ear).  Listeners tell me I sound a little faint.* It doesn't breathe around the ear (you can get hot or sweaty).  This may be unavoidable for the desired level of noise elimination.  I got used to this pretty quickly and it doesn't bother me much any more.* Stationary, there's no problem, but if you're walking and stepping heavily, and if the battery is low, it might crackle or cut out for a moment.  I think this only happens when the battery is low.* If you're outside and there is any wind, it will make a whistling noise.Overall: better than anything I've tried previously, for noise reduction and sound, for use in the office or relaxing at home.P.S.  I would wish that at this price point it would include Bluetooth and Airplay but it doesn't."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Wife uses them on all our trips. Comfortable for long term use. Cuts out outside noise really well. No problems yet.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've read a lot of reviews on here that are from audiophiles with an acute understanding of what makes a set of headphones good... for them.  I'm a regular guy, though, and honestly I won't be able to comment on the nuances of highs, lows and mid ranges.  I can however, tell you about these headphones from the perspective of an average guy who has used them every day for the past year - and if you're like me, then hopefully this 'average guy' review will help you out.SOUND:  Like I said, I can't speak about sound quality relative to other headphones at a technical level.  What I can tell you is that to me, these head phones sound great.  The defining sound characteristic that I would use is clarity.  When you put the headphones on, and turn up the volume, there is a distinctly clear sound.  Every hit of percussion, ever rumble, every note sung by every voice all sounds perfectly clear, as though you're in the room with the music being played.  The first time I heard it, I was blown away.  And I think the true testament to its quality of their sound is that when I put them on, the still amaze me.BASS:  A lot of people I've spoken to love bass.  They love that deep, booming, low frequency rumble.  If that's your thing, then these probably aren't the head phones for you.  They have good lows, but it's not going to shake your ears.  Again, the bass is solid and crystal clear, but it's not like putting on a set of Beats headphones which, for my tastes, have a little too much bass.NOISE CANCELLING:  Hands down THE best feature on these headphones.  The main reason I got these was so that I could tune out noisy environments and focus on either the music, or my task at hand.  I sampled a lot in various stores, and these were 100% the best.  All noise cancelling headphones work on the same principal - they play opposite frequencies of what's going on outside to eliminate the noise when you're listening.  Bose nailed it.  It works best with constant noises (i.e. jet engines, bus engines, etc...), and it's nothing short of amazing to hear - or not hear!COMFORT:  If you're like me, and you have your headphones on a good portion of the day, then comfort is king.  My ears aren't small, but they still fit comfortably inside the cups.  The cups themselves, gently rest on the top of your ear, but in a way that is truly unobtrusive.  The padded head rest is simple, elegant, and incredibly comfortable.  I've had these on up to 10-12 hours a day, and not once in the past year have I ever felt discomfort.  In some ways, you don't even realize you're wearing them.BUILD QUALITY:  Excellent.  They feel solid.  They're sturdy and great to look at.  The battery port which you will have to open and close opens well, and secures perfect every time.  They cost about 300 bucks, and they feel like it.  I did have one technical issue which I'll address below in customer service.CUSTOMER SERVICE:  I had an issue where my left cup was occasionally giving me some static.  It didn't always do it, and it would have been next to impossible to replicate on demand.  Regardless, I called up customer service and I was blown away by how amazing they were.  First - I actually spoke to someone after an incredibly short wait which is a rarity these days.  The individual I spoke to was kind, courteous, and assured me that they'd replace my headphones immediately, even if they couldn't replicate the issue.  They sent me a return label (since I purchased on Amazon as opposed to in the store), and as soon as I shipped them back to Bose, Bose shipped me a brand new set.  On top of that, the new set they sent me came with it's own BRAND NEW warranty.  I don't know of any other company that will give you a completely new warranty when your original product has an issue.  Bose simply has the best customer service.  It's part of what you pay for, and 9 times out of 10 you won't need them.  But when you do, you'll understand why they're the best.ACCESSORIES:  The headphones come with a nice case that is perfect for safely transporting your headphones, a couple spare batteries, and your headphone cables.  You'll also get two headphone jacks - one which has an microphone in it for use with your phone's voice calling features, and another that is just a simple connector.  I leave that one at work and it's conveniently always there for me.CONS:  The only con on this headphone set is the battery requirements. Since these have active noise cancellation, they need power to run, and power requires battery.  I use standard AAA batteries, and one battery will last me about two weeks of daily use.  When the battery runs out, you'll have to pop another one in as the headphones won't operate without them.  That is literally my ONLY complaint, but it's a fair trade for how fantastic the noise cancellation is.From the perspective of an average consumer, I can say without reservation that these headphones will blow you away and are worth EVERY penny.  If you're on the fence about them, don't be.  These should be your new headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are fantastic headphones and are considerably better at reducing low frequency noises like jet engines, wind, and road noise than the prior version (The QC2). They are very comfortable, and like the QC2s before them, come with a nice carrying case that can also hold an Ipod or other MP3 player.I've been using noise cancelling (""NC"") headphones since I purchased my first pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2's about 7 years ago. NC headphones are great for eliminating both road noise when going on long car trips and for eliminating engine and wind noise when flying on commercial airliners. None of the noise cancelling headphones on the market today are good at cancelling out noise from people talking, babies crying, etc., and so if you're looking for something to do that, you'll be unhappy with any NC headphone, including these.After I owned the QC2 for a while, I compared them to comparable products from Sennheiser (PXC-250) and Sony. My verdict then was that the QC2's were better, but the Sennheisers (PXC-250) were also quite good, particularly considering the price difference (the Sennheiser model was about $100 back then). I found the Sony models to be way too heavy and too small for my head.A few years later, Bose put out the QC3, which was as good as the QC2, but required you to use a proprietary rechargeable battery. The QC3 was also a bit smaller than the QC2 and did not completely cover year ear. I'm against proprietary rechargeables, because they are expensive, and you will often find yourself with a dead battery and no way to charge them. The QC2's used standard AAA batteries, which allows me to use standard alkaline or re-chargeable Nichel Metal Hydride batteries.I'm pleased to see that the QC15's don't continue the trend towards expensive, proprietary batteries. Instead, they use standard AAA's, just like the QC2s. Even better, the QC15 is considerably better at noise reduction than the QC2. If you can spare $300, it's well worth the upgrade.If you can't afford $300, the $100 Sennheiser PXC-250 is a very good second choice. The PXC-250 does not cover your ears, and so it won't really block out any external noise. In contrast, the QC15's do cover your ears and thus have some noise reduction just by virtue of the fact that they cover your ears.In either case, I highly recommend that you purchase Eneloop rechargeable batteries, which keep their charge for up to a year when not used, and a La Crosse BC-900 charger, both of which you can buy at Amazon.com."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Got these for my many flights. Noise cancelling is simply excellent. If combined with ear plugs I cannot imagine what would wake you up. Music and sound books sound great to me but I'm no audiofile others may differ. Because these are closed to keep out noise I get hot around my ears on longer trips and wake up with ""sweaty"" ears. Not a big deal for me but may be good to know before you buy. I do not think they feel flimsy but I have not had them long enough to say anything about their life span. On the other hand I can say this; if they serve me well for 2 years I will consider it a good purchase, as heavy travel does tend to wear down things faster than at home. One star off for the somewhat high price (even if I do not see any real competition at this price point).UPDATE: Thought I had lost these and bought the Bose QC3 in stead. So now I can compare the two main Bose models directly.Noise cancelling effect:Noise cancelling system is equally effective on both models. However, the closed design of the QC15 give them a slight advantage when it comes to sheer noise blocking (not all noises are handled by the noise cancelling system).Music:No difference to me. But as mentioned above I not an audiophile and I spend far most time listening to audio books anyway.Comfort:This is probably what people should choose after between the two. QC15 cannot escape the fact they are bulky + closed design may give you  ""sweaty"" ears as mentioned above. However, I personally still prefer QC15 because my ears are quite sensitive to presure and I cannot have the QC3 mounted for a long distance flight (5 hours+) without resting my ears once in a while. Not doubt that QC3 are easier to sleep with due to less bulk if you have a custom shaped pillow (I always bring one with a special ""dip"" for the earphones).Operation:Same cord system and built-in remote iphone/ipad control. However, the battery system is distinctly different. The QC15 takes standard batteries while the QC3 relies on a special battery unit you have to charge. The special battery on the QC3 saves weight and lasts for 15 hours (also in real life use). However, the draw down is of course the need for a charger, special battery and for charging. As I do gruelling 30 hour+ flights this is an issue. Some people buy an extra battery for their QC3. Recommended if you travel a lot but it adds even more to the extra price for the QC3.Travel size/weight:In-box the size difference is too small to matter. The QC3 box is smaller, but not by much. The QC15 case is actually more neat on the inside because there are fewer parts to go around and the QC3 box design seems less well thought out. QC3 is lighter and you can feel the difference.Conclusion:Get the pair that fits your ears - I deeply regretted getting the QC3 instead and am very happy that I have my QC15 back - but YMMV and QC3 may be the better choice for others."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My first set of these was a split second decision at an airport just before I boarded an overseas flight. I had never had a set on before and had to set them up on the airplane. Nothing to it, just put in the battery. Plugged them into my Ipod and it was like hearing music for the first time. These things are amazing. they are so comfortable I don't realize I have them on. I plug them into the airplane system to watch movies, into the computer to watch a late night movie in bed, or just for the quiet. Won't travel without them now. I still can't sleep on an airplane, but it knocks out most of the plane noise and the flight is much more enjoyable and I barely notice the screaming little kids that always seem to be near by. My new wife spends a lot of time on the phone or computer talking to her friends and family in Thailand and we both love them for that. She can hear perfectly and I can't hear them perfectly when she wears them. Great product, recommend them highly. I had never seen these below $299, but Amazon came through with a better price. Thanks Amazon"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,It's a heaven sent for noisy environment like where I work. I could care less now about people yapping all days or printers around my office...yeahhhh!!!.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I own both the Bose QC15 and Beats Studio and these headphones are way better than Beats in terms of build and sound quality.  Get this if you care about quality and get the Beats if you're just trying to make a hipster fashion statement.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,what?  noise cancelling headphones that i can't charge?  what the hell is that?  i had to buy a boat load of triple a batteries.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bose products are said to be good; unfortunately, Bose has begun infesting my net usage with pop-ups.  I never support companies who can't lay out an honest, off-to-the-side advertisement, but instead employ crude, in-your-face vulgarity."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"i haven't used any other products, but these work great! used them on the plane many times, and they work flawlessly.  cancels out quite a bit of the noise so you hear your audio more clearly without having to crank up the volume too high!  very comfortable, you can wear them for hours without them hurting.  batteries last a very long time as well, so no worries about running out of juice mid-flight on long trips.  ear cups are easy to replace as well if needed.  bose customer service is great.  if they are still under warranty, you can ask for replacement cups or cord, and they'll ship them for free, no questions asked.  just make sure you register them on their site!  accidentally caught the headphone wire with my vacuum, and the connector snatched off.  since there is a connecting end on the headphone, this was easily replaced.  a little pricey, but worth the money.  i am however curious to compare them to the less expensive audio technica models."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I saw some videos compare this headphone with Beat on Youtube. then I think this is the right one I should buy. noise cancelling is so good!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I love them and they do cut outside noise from the music or anything else you are listening too. Pretty good bass but not exceptional bass. Pure sound.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"For starters I have had these for well over a year now using for 6+ hours a day, so I'm not just reviewing a product I got yesterday like most reviews you'll see.  I absolutely love these headphones, the sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is incredible, by far the best I have ever tried, out of the 10 or so others that I have used including Sony, Dre, and many others. My only complaint with them is that after a year they stopped working where the place that you plug the cable into the headphones got damaged causing them to no play any sound, the reason why this review is still 5 stars though is because Bose has unquestionable  far the best customer service of any company I have ever dealt with, when I told them the problem and how they were out of warranty based on the sales date but not the date I had received them. They had immediately agreed to exchange them for new ones.  They even paid for the shipping both ways which is something I had never seen a company ever do (usually with higher-end things you pay to ship it to them and they pay to ship it back). If you are in the market for noise cancelling headphones with great sound, plus don't want a company giving you the run around as soon as something goes wrong, then I strongly recommend that you by these.Lastly, the ones I had at first was the old version, the ones they were replaced with are the new version."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are amazing.Once you put them on, you can still hear background noise. Then you turn on the noise cancellation switch, and the loudest plane noises are gone. I can't image flying without these headphones.Also they are very light and comfortable."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Good - Well designed, great dynamic sound and noise reduction is the best out there.Bad - no option to listen without noise cancelling feature."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Bought these as a present for my son who travels a lot.  He had borrowed my older model Bose headphones and liked them a lot.  So I wanted mine back and gave him the new ones
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Comfortable and great sounding, these headphones are the best! They are so effective at blocking out background noise that your kids will NEVER hear you again while hearing these. That's annoying but the headphones deliver on the heritage of Bose sound quality very well."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I did a lot of research on these headphones.  I didn't want to pay the full price on them and thought that ebay or other cheaper options on Amazon would work.  I realized that this product is so much more than headphones and that little things that are critical could be wrong with an underpriced one.  The microphone in it is specifically designed to cancel the noise - if there is anything subpar or broken with it - you've completely waisted your money on a 'deal'.  So I decided to pay full price & actually got a price cut with getting an Amazon credit card instead.Flight time: This cuts out that airplane noise about 90%.  I kept thinking it didn't really matter overall, but amazingly when I used them, I felt so much calmer on all the flights and that really is a big deal with all the stress of traveling.  I originally bought these because we had a red eye flight and I wanted to sleep.  It worked pretty well, but it does not cut out sharp noises, kids crying.  You can actually hear someone talking directly to you pretty well which can be good or bad depending on the situation.  But overall, it's the best product & technology out there.  It was worth it to us.  (It also cuts out the sound of snoring at night too).FYI - I didn't take the time to read the instructions ahead of time for my flights & wished I could control the volume - later I discovered there's a hidden volume control inside the cord connection."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Very happy with the Bose headphones - I have used mainly for travel. They fit well around the ear & are very comfortable (as a smaller person the headband fits a little loose even at its most compact setting but the pad at the top helps so they don't slide off). Lighter weight then expected for the technology. Noise canceling is impressive in environments with continuous low to moderate level noise (airplane, in home or public places) but does not cancel all noises out completely. Loud talking and high volume noises (ex. a movie with hefty action scenes) are muffled but audible. Sound quality is good but seems a little flat when the noise canceling option is enabled. Headphones come with a nice carrying case to keep them in one piece - easily fits into a backpack or medium sized travel bag. Overall great product for portability, comfort, & some peace & quiet."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I was influenced by very high consumer reports rating and as always they are right. I used this on an international BA flight and it worked great. Didn't need any additional adapters. I use this at work and I can see a positive difference. I love this product. No issues so far.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have these headphones from Bose and a set of Able Planet True Fidelity Active Noise Canceling Headphones. My husband also has the Able Planet headphones.  I absolute love my Bose headphones since my husband and I have our office in the same room.  He speaks pretty loud during his conference calls and I don't want to hear him talking since I need to concentrate on writing and analysis projects, so the Bose works great in this regard. I switched to the Bose from the Able Planet headphones since I became frustrated with hearing my husband through the Able Planet headphones.  I am very glad that I switched!  On top of the better noise cancellation, the Bose headphones are way more comfortable for me.  I wear earrings, so that may be a factor, but I'm not going to take my earrings off and on when I put my headphones on.  Of course, the sound quality is great and I use the convenient microphone for my own webinars/conference calls.  People say they can hear me just great.  Another thing I noticed with the Bose is the case is much smaller for travel and the switch on the headphones is in a much better position when storing.  The Able Planet switch would get accidentally turned on during travel and the battery would end up dead (so I started taking out during travel).  But either way, I am not going back to Able Planet now, the Bose headphones are for me.For those of you who are concerned about the price, I would say it depends on your needs or wants.  The battery can be easily taken out of the Able Planet for travel and if you do not have a loud officemate to worry about the noise cancelling works pretty good for travel considering the price.  Also ask yourself how much noise cancelling do you want?  Bose definitely works the best and is more comfortable as well."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These Bose QuietComfort 15 noise canceling headphones are the perfect solution for me to read in quiet. I love being immersed in a book on my Kindle, while my husband watches TV. I was just too distracted by all the noise in the room. The noise cancelling feature puts everything in the background, and with a relaxation audio playing, all other sound disappears. (I use an underwater MP3 while I read.) The sound quality is vibrant and rich, and the ear cups are incredibly soft, so they are extremely comfortable. They offer the superior quality that I have come to expect from Bose, and come with a nice hard case for storage or travel. Wonderful!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've heard all the jokes about Bose.  I've even made a few of them myself, and I don't consider their products to be bad, just not worth the premium price.  I use audiophile level equipment in my home, and I seriously debated about a pair of B&W; P5's instead of these.Now, let me say that the B&W;'s sound far better than the Bose.  However, I have B&W; speakers in my home.  I don't need the Bose there.  Where I do need them is on the road.  This is where the Bose shines.  The noise canceling feature works as described and is absolutely wonderful.  I use them in the office, on the plane, on the train, and everywhere else in between.  Often, I'm using them without any music at all, because I just want to shut the world out so I can concentrate and do work or sleep or whatever it is I need to do.You'll find among frequent travelers, this is the headphone of choice.  There's a reason, and it's simply that nothing comes close to the noise canceling these headphones provide.As far as playing music through them?  Well, they're Bose.  They're good quality Bose, but they're still Bose.  Still, they're better than most products out there, including the ultra-trendy Dre Beats, and will beat any in-ear headphone you want to name.  They could be better, but I can't complain.  I didn't pay $300 for them for the audiophile sound quality.  I paid for the noise canceling, which it delivers in spades and would be worth the $300 even if it didn't play music at all."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Got these as a reward for my points on my credit card after what, 10 years of credit card use?  But they were free so I can't complain.  I was debating whether or not to get these or the Beats Studio so I went in to Best Buy to check them both out myself.  The Beats really looked and felt flimsy.  I really wasn't that impressed with the build quality at all.  They just seemed poorly made and comparing the two I felt like the Beats would not hold up very well in the long run.  The Bose QC 15's felt way better IMO.  I tried both on and maybe I have small ears, but they both covered them pretty well.  Sound wise I was only able to listen to the Bose because the Beats had a broken cable so the music didn't come through the headphones at all. The Bose sounded really good and while I didn't get to hear the Beats, just by the way they felt and how flimsy they looked, I chose the Bose.  They came in yesterday and I was amazed at how well they blocked out ambient noise.  I had a basketball game on close by and they just blocked about 95% of the sound right out without any music playing.  Once I played some music they I could hardly hear anything else at all.  Very impressed and I can't wait to try them on my next trip!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Well the title says it all, I hate to buy things because of the name. And I have always felt that Bose was always over loved just because it's a Bose. Little back story, my wife has been bugging me for years about my midnight snack habit; crunch chew, swallow. What can I say I get hungry when watching mindless zombie movies. Well these little wonders of technology are great. So not only can I crunch away but I can turn up the zombie madness.Made very well, have a 300 dollar feel to them, so don't worry about the cost. They do block out a lot of noise, maybe not all of the bubble guppies, they have loud pricing voices. But seriously, I'm thinking about a second set for me!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money on these, but I am so glad that I did.  What finally made me do so was facing a trip from Minnesota to Bangalore, India.  I'm a light sleeper, so I wasn't looking forward to it.  I'm not sure that I would have survived without them.  Because they go around the ears, it was hard to get comfortable with them on, but they did a terrific job on blocking the sound and I was able to sleep some.  Since then, I've used them on other flights where people around me were noisy and it really decreased my stress level to be able to shut it out.  I must say that I think that they couple with the engine noise to work better.  In my office, I find that a lot of the ambient noise around me still comes through unless I turn the music up a little higher than I want to when I'm trying to concentrate.  That said, not a moment of regret - they paid for themselves on that one trip alone."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"EDIT: I have decided to deduct another star from this product to 2 stars from 3.Since as mentioned the Bose build quality is so fragile, and I saw a steal on Newegg on Sennheiser HD428 for a mere $30, I bought it for my office to use as a work horse.The moment I put on the Sennheiser is like ""holy... this is where all my sounds have been hiding"". The audio stage of this un-burned, brand new headphones is just so much wider, so much fuller than Bose, which has been burned in properly.Too late to return the Bose and it's still good for noise cancellation on the planes. But I don't see any reasons to buy the Bose if you don't fly monthly.-----I have to say I am quite disappointed in this purchase, though it's not bad enough that I kept it. I will personally not purchase another Bose product after this experience and you should know your priority if you want to but this product.Noise cancellation: 9/10Needless to say, very good. If you fly every week, this will be a great purchase for you.Audio quality: 3/10Extremely disappointing. It sounds worse than the $100 Klipsch headphones I have, sounds even worse than my car audio. Admittedly my car has a nice B&O; system, but a headphone should not sound worse than a car, period.The base is non-existent... It's not weak, it's not muddled, it's just not there. So basically you miss out on a big chunk of music you are listening to. Treble is nothing to write home about and the sound stage is very weak for a headphone. Basically, you can get better audio quality from $100 headphones.Build quality: 3/10It's built like a $50 phone and the plastic has a very flimsy quality to it. I am pretty sure it will break down within 3 years of light use.Comfort: 6/10Surprisingly not good too, but this is very personal and much depends on your ear size and shape. It doesn't cover my rather large ears completely and you can clearly feel the pressure. Maybe it will get better after more usage.I kept this purely because I have other better-sounding headphones and home audio system, and this one will just be used for flying. If you are looking for an all-rounder and want great audio quality, I would suggest you to skip this one."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These could NOT of arrived sooner. Daily dealings with overly rambunctious co-worker conversations had me thinking these might be a good idea. I could NOT be more happy. Once you put them on you're in your own little world. You can still hear someone if they talk, but it's so much more easily ignored. I plugged mine into my Mac and enjoy Spotify without ANY interruptions. Highly recommended for sound quality and all-out sanity :)"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Can i give this 6 stars??  Wow, this is truly an awesome set of headphones.  Love them for their noise cancelling, and they also give 2 different audio cords to connect to a phone/mp3 device.  It allows you to control a iphone/ipod/ipad with one of them too."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Just received mine yesterday - the only thing I have found thus far is that the instructions could be clearer and simpler.  Took me a few minutes to find out how to put the battery in. :)  I work in an office building that has white noise generation, and I also sit right underneath an air handler that has a serious rumble to it, not to mention the sound of the air actually moving.  It's not annoying, but it's loud.  I put these on, without the power switch turned on, and could still hear all of it.  Flipped the power switch and all I could hear was deafening silence.  My next trip is a few weeks out - be interesting to see how these perform seated next to an engine on an A321, but I am expecting them to work quite well - much better than my Sony N/C headphones that broke on this last trip....  Will post a followup review if I experience anything less than expected, but right now, I am VERY happy!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The last time I tried Noise Reduction headphones, it was over a decade ago.  They were pointless then and I never gave it a second thought.  But that was then.  Things have changed.These headphones are amazing, but these aren't for everyone.  Who should buy these?  People that are easily irritated by random noises, ambient noise, that kind of thing.  What's that?  On my list, I'd put in dog barks, refrigerator hums, bathroom pipes, passing cars, wind and rain, etc.  I'm very sensitive to noise.  I bought a wall clock specifically without a ticking noise because it drives me insane.A couple months ago, some dude moved into a nearby apartment unit.  He's got some kind of affliction that is a cross between emphysema and tourette's syndrome.  He'll make some sort of ""Hnnghh!"" sound every minute or so right out his window.  This goes on all day and all night and for someone like me who is easily annoyed, it can make a muhfuh go postal.Now, I'm a headphone nerd.  I've got a Sennheiser HD-650, a Denon AH-D2000, tried all the upper-middle class Beyerdynamics, Audio Technicas and what have you.  How's this sound in relation to the grade A audiophile headphones?  The sound signature on these is a bit less bassy than your average Bose product.  If I use bass boost on my iPod Touch, it sounds about right.  It doesn't compete with my HD-650 or D2000 and you should not buy these if all you want is great music.You should buy this if you can't stand stupid little distracting noises that drive you up the wall.  Have ADHD?  This is the headphone for you.  You can turn it on (one AAA non-rechargeable battery) and let noise cancelling work.  You can detach the wire so that nothing is in your way if you just really want to get work done.  I'm studying for the BAR Exam and little noises can derail an entire day.You might be saying to yourself that you can just use earplugs instead of spending $300.  And you can.  I've used earplugs for the last few years.  These headphones are so much more comfortable, they block more noise, and you can actually put on music if you want.  It's one of those things that you didn't know you needed until you have it.  You'll also notice how you can leave the volume very low on your music player because there's no need to drown out extraneous ambient noise.  The perfect headphone for people with tinnitus.Now, the aesthetics.  Let's face it, these look like garbage.  Who's the kind of person that thinks these look good?  Look at the stock photo.  Those are the people.  No style, no taste.  People who collect glass figurines.  Those people.  So this purchase is going to strictly be a utilitarian one.  Yes, it looks like crap.  But more importantly, it neutralizes noise.  My God, it's about as close as you can get to enjoying the silence of the night desert while living in the heart of a downtown metropolis.If you're OCD about noise, if you're the kind of person who stays up all night on the internet and can't get to sleep for stupid reasons, if refrigerator buzzing, laundry and dishwasher cycles, passing cars bug you more than it does other people, then look no further.  Sell your kidney on the black market and get these ugly headphones.EDIT:  December 12, 2011One thing that bummed me out about these was the lack of bluetooth.  I turned these into a bluetooth model by ordering a Jabra Clipper.  I've use the excess wire to wrap the Clipper against the headband and now I'm completely wireless.  It pairs perfectly with my MacBook Air 2011 model.  No issues whatsoever.  I also have a Lenovo x120e, but it cuts out intermittently on that notebook.  Don't know if it's a Windows 7 issue or a Lenovo issue.  IPod Touch works without issue as well.Just a little FYI if you want to go bluetooth wireless.  I imagine you're not limited to the Jabra Clipper.  It should work with other devices like the Sony Ericsson MW600, but I can't vouch for solid pairing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tested the noise canceling ability of these headphones on a 10 hour flight to Hawaii. They reduced the ambient noise level of the airplane by at least 90%. When I had it connected to my Ipod, the music quality was superb, and the noise cancelBose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphonesing was complete. I also tested the headphones at my WOW gym, where there is a lot of background noise. Once again the background noise is almost completely cancelled and the audio from the TV or my Ipod is great. These headphones are well worth the money."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Noisy kids on long flights drive me nuts and this quieted them out significantly! Even better I didn't have to crank up my music because these cancelled out a lot of the noise on the flight. My ears weren't ringing at the end of the flight and they felt great on my ears after long use. Thank heaven! or Bose!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Best product I've ever had along with my Ecco slip on dress shoes. Yes, the construction on the headphones seems somewhat 'cheap'. But the only time I've broken them (I've had two pairs now) was my own fault. When I took care of them, they were perfection. Also, Bose is one helluva good company to deal with for customer service. They stunned me with their ability to exceed my expectations.*********important update***************If I were to do this all over again, I would also consider Klipsch, in the ear, noise cancelling earphones. They only work with music but they are $260.00 less than the Bose headphones. I love my Bose - but I want people who are on a budget to know that an alternative that works quite well, is the Klipsch $40.00, in the ear, noise cancelling earphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Im sure these are great headphones, but as other have commented, the noise cancellation feature put pressure on the eardrums and was unbearable for me after a few minutes.Gave me a great headache.I couldn't get used to it.  Back they go."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bose QC15 vs. Sennheiser PXC 450 vs. Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7bDisclosure: I have tried all these on an airplane. I am not an audiophile. Noise Cancelation is the most important attribute to me.The Carrying Case: All three are quite durable and stiff.1.) Bose- the smallest, a low profile, room for an Ipod, accessories too.2.) Sennheiser- Square shape, low profile, however not a lot of room for anything else in case.3.) Audio Technica- Nice big case if you want to carry extra stuff (Nintendo DS, ipod, etc).Build Quality:1.) Sennheiser- you can tell this is built VERY well. Strong plastics, good components, thick cord. Top notch. You feel like you are getting something really high quality.2.) Audio Technica- Nice solid construction, appears durable.3.) Bose- If this had a Sanyo logo on the side, I would not have flinched. How can something $300 be so incredibly cheaply made.Size:1.) Bose- as far as over the ears go, these are pretty small.2.) Audio-Technica- mid-sized.3.) Sennheiser- These are big. No question, but they store flat.Comfort:1.) Sennheiser- Very comfortable, will fit almost any size ears. Keep on for hours.2.) Bose- Also comfortable. I did not experience ""highs"" discomfort.3.) Audio-Technica- Perfectly satisfactory. Larger opening than previous AT model.  Gets warm and tight on head on long flights.Sound:1.) Sennheiser- I actually wore these at home too, simply to hear parts of songs I had never heard before. Astounding. My 10yr old music collection sounded totally NEW.2.) Audio-Technica- Well balanced, good sound.3.) Bose- Great sound, but very heavy on the bass. I listen to a lot of rap and pop, so it was mildly annoying. I ultimately had to turn my treble settings up on my ipod to balance the sound.Features:1.) Sennheiser- nice cord, push to talk button (temporarily mutes NC and sound which is great for interruptions on airplanes).2.) Bose/Audio Technica- just the basics. Bose simply an on/off switch.Price:1.) Audio Technica- $150 to $225 depending on how you shop.2.) Sennheiser- $200 to $2753.) Bose- Hard to find below $300+.Noise Cancelation:1.) Bose- No question here, far surpassed the other two. Best Noise Cancelation.2.) Audio-Technica- Good Noise Cancelation.3.) Sennheiser- Not sure what happened here. Incredible sound, satisfactory noise cancelation.Summary:I ultimately kept the Bose because I was only using these for flying and the Sennheiser's (as much as I loved them) let me down in the Noise Cancelation department. The Sennheiser's had by far the most superior sound, but the Bose Noise Cancelation was night and day. The Bose are made very poorly for a $300+ product, it was disappointing.Final assessment:Audio-Technica- best balance of value for moneySennheiser- Best sound and comfortBose- Best Noise Cancelation"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Initial Impressions:Construction is mediocre, but not poor.  About what you'd get with phones costing no more than say $100-125.,,, built MUCH better than the headphones that come ith with even the best portable audio players. (of course, you'd expect that!) THOSE types of headphones are worth $15-20 at best!  The two included connecting cords are rather thin but adequate. They are easily attachable/detatchable.  What I DO like is that the cords are replaceable.  One cord is a straight line, like ordinary connecting cord, the other cord includes a microphone, voice command/start/stop button and two volume control buttons. They are both plenty long enough (over 5' long) for normal connections to your iPhone/iPod etc. The headphone end of each connecting cord has a high/low switch for volume... but volume is NOT continuiously variable.Now the PUDDING!  Listening!First the sound quality in any room setting is very good, but not excellent.  It's comparable to headphones costing lno more than $125-150.  The reason I bought these is for when I know that I'll be in a noisy environment... such as in an aircraft or perhaps a bowling alley during tournament nights... etc. Thes headphones blow away the competition when it comes to noise reduction (the proper term is &#34;noise CANCELLATION&#34;)  Before I retired 3 years ago, (early retirement!) I worked as a tecjhnician and had to know about audio and acoustics (even harmonics).Noise cancellation works on the principal that if you combine two identical signals of equal amplitude BUT opposite polarity, the audio signal will be cancelled out. There are TWO microphones on each ear cup, one outside and one INSIDE.  The one outside samples the sounds around you and reduces lower frequencies, such as that from jet engines.  it generates identical frequencies at the same amplitude SPL (sound pressure level) in reverse polarity. The microphone iniside the earcup samples the sound insiide and through DSP (digital signal processing)  smooth out the higher frequencies"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Best of Headphones in the market! These headphones are the right stuff for traveling. Recommend for air travel and anything else where you want to filter noise and concentrate in your business.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've used Sony's MDR-NC60's and liked them, but they were never that great. The ableplanet Linx Audio worked well, but were uncomfortable on my ears. It also had a poorly placed on/off switch that could be easily turned on while being stored. I really like the comfort of Sony's MDR-NC60 (which is now discontinued) and the closest model is the Sony MDR-NC500D, but it's $400 and has less than stellar reviews. I took a chance on the Bose QuietComfort 15, and I LOVE them! They are actually more comfortable than the Sony's, and the noise cancellation and sound quality blows the other two brands out of the water. I'm very pleased and I wouldn't hesitate from buying these if you want the ""perfect"" noise canceling headphones for work and travelling."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are top notch.  Expensive, yes, but worth the money.  The sound quality is crystal clear, and the noise cancellation is not equalled by anything on the market.  I can not believe how well these cancel surrounding noise.  If you work in a cubicle with background noise, or similar, you will love these things.  I would agree that these don't over enhance the bass like some other headphones, but these provide a very realistic sounding experience.  I also appreciate how nice of a case these come in, and the quality of the product.  I'm very happy with these and would recommend to others."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These were a birthday gift for a very deserving teen grandson / musician.  I've used them for years for air travel - there are none as good.  Bose commits highway robbery price-wise, but produce the finest product, and so I keep returning to the trough, smiling and grumbling."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I so wanted to like these headphones. The NC feature is just amazing, and I take a long commute to work. Just like other people have pointed out, some sensitive people might get dizzy or headaches from use of the product. It's a shame, really, because I love the product. I realize it's not for me and I may not be able to wear any NC headphone without feeling ill. My suggestion is try them out before committing. Note: Trying them for 10 minutes at the store is not enough time to catch this rare side effect.You can buy them and try them out, and if you develop this make sure you return them ASAP to get your money back. I know I will."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,First let me say my Bose In The Ear Headphones and Regular non Noise Cancelling Headphone are things I would not leave home without.  I was hoping to get even better from the Bose 15.  First off even though the noise cancelling is perfect It leaves you with a Big headache even when on the ground like after you've been on a long flight on an airplane.  Second Off it takes 1 AAA battery and won't run without it.  third there I no switch to turn off the noise canceling and not have to use the battery.  those are the bad though I would get it out of the way first.The sound quality is just okay for $300.00 I though the sound quality would be a lot better.  the big reason to get these headphones is if you need the Noise Cancelling part and don't mind the headache  for that reason because they are the best at keeping sound out they get three stars.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"In the past when looking for noise canceling or noise reduction headphones or ear buds I shied away from the Bose because of price opting for cheaper alternatives. What with not being happy with any of them for differing reasons I finally decided to step up to the plate and give the Bose QuietComfort's a try. What the heck, I thought, I can always return them if I don't like them. Well, I'm happy to say that won't be the case.The Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones not only do an excellent job of blocking out the noise but also deliver exceptional sound quality. A recent trip to and from the US to Perth, Australia I got the wear them for an extended period of time (about 21 hours each way). They were extremely comfortable; I didn't have to crank up the sound to listen to my movies because of their excellent noise canceling capabilities; and, when not listening to music or movies they allowed me to rest and sleep peacefully as a result of their comfort and them blocking out the noise. I am now a firm believer that these are one of the best if not the best noise canceling headphones available, especially for travelers.Bottom line, don't sit on the fence about spending the money to buy these versus a cheaper alternative. I can assure you, you won't regret buying them!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tried many different types of headphones and earbuds. Looking for the best quality audio response and and noise cancelling.These headphones just work for me.Pros- Great quality audio and noise canceeling, Lighweight. Easy to useCons - No Android phone adapter (works only on Iphone). Audio not the loudest I've heard. Price."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Glad Bose dropped the price in 8/13. Maybe they are coming out with a new model. This one is so good, I don't know what they could do the make it better. Very clear and they are the king of noise canceling when flying. They are not completely flat but my personal taste is to leave the EQ on iTunes off when using them. Lots of options. I've tried a number of high end cans and there is no comparison. Yes, they require a good battery to use them. So put another AAA in the case and you are ready for another 30 hrs. This is because they probably use a DSP that not only does the NC but also tailors (EQ) the signal to make the speakers they use really perform well. Don't fight it, just enjoy the magic. The iPhone mic cable works fine too. Nothing fancy. Play/pause and volume. The mic in the cable works well and can be used for other apps using a mic like a dictation app. It's one of the only mics that allow my deep voice to work with Siri. It appears that you can also purchase adapters that allow this cable to work with other phone makes."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This product only has 1366 reviews so it's in desperate need of another one.Seriously, this goes out to all the older folks. You know who you are.For years I used really cheap headphones, the kind you can buy for $10 or so. Why? Because I'm cheap. Deal with it.As I got older my hearing got worse (don't laugh you youngsters, it'll happen to you too).  I finally gave in and got hearing aids and they help a lot but in some ways they work too well. I'm hearing things I've never heard before and it's annoying if you're trying to listen to music or watch a movie (I use a Roku device).I finally took a few bills out from under my mattress and bought this product. I figured I'd give it a try and if it didn't live up to the reviews then good old Amazon would be getting a return. No way I'd return these!  The noise cancelling feature is wonderful. Put them on, turn them on and you can hardly hear yourself speak let alone anyone else and kiss any ambient noise goodbye. On top of that the sound coming out of these is amazing. I never knew what I was missing.  Because I wear hearing aids I really had to jack the volume down on my iPod/iPad and TV.I also like the compactness. You can fold them up and put them in the nice carrying case that comes with the headphones. I haven't had the opportunity to use these on an airplane but I have no doubt I wouldn't hear the roar of the engine or the person sitting next to me. I have used them outdoors near a busy highway - wait, highway? what highway? I saw cars but they didn't make any noise.My only regret is that I didn't buy these or something like them a long time ago."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Too many people are critical of these headphones because they claim the music sound is not good enough for their tastes.  No one really criticizes the noise canceling feature, but some say there is not enough bass.  I disagree.  THese headphones are superior to any others on the market and provide all the sound quality one could ask for.  I've had many, many headphones over the years and I can say that none even come close to these in sound quality.  Depending on the music one listens to, these headphones will provide a sound experience like none other.  Speaking for my own collection, I can appreciate the instrumentals and the lyric songs as never before.The product arrived at my house and I immediately started listening to my iPod and even purchased a few new songs to round out my collection.  The headphones come with a sturdy case, an airplane adapter jack, a battery, and two cables.  One cable is supposedly for Apple products though I'd be hardpressed to tell the difference.  The only way I knew one was for Apple is because it was labeled as such.  I kept it in my case even when listening to my iPad and iPod.You can probably tell I'm not an audio expert, but I do believe these are the best product on the market and no one is even close to competing with Bose.  I do appreciate music as my primary source of technological entertainment (reading is still tops on my list) so a good set of headphones is critical for me.  The noise cancelling finally drowns out the television, annoying kids, and even my wife.  With that in mind, who could complain?I looked at these for months in the electronics store, viewed Youtube videos, read consumer reports before I made my purchase.  I can afford them but still they cost $300.  I hemmed and hawed, repeated my research and finally thought that I had waited long enough.  I wish I had made up my mind far earlier.  THese are excellent headphones and I look forward to many hours of music enjoyment with them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these to drown out noisy neighbors. Very surprised that I couldn't hear all the noise associated with them moving in above me. I could feel the vibrations of the furniture moving, but not hear it. I'm very impressed."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I generally use these when I travel.  I'm not the type who walks around with earbuds or headphones on; I like to engage with the world around me.  However; when on an airplane or in a terminal they are great for either listening to music or just to deaden the surrounding sounds.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Ok, it's a clever trick - you don't realize how much a/c noise or whatever is around until these cancels it, and it's quite astonishing when it goes away.  Woo-hoo, pass them around your friends.But...  They don't actually /sound/ any good.  Loud bass, which pleases the crowds, but musically they're just downright bad.  Next to any half-way decent headphones they produce muffled, lifeless music.  Listen to the strumming of a guitar and it's just tones with none of the rich acoustic texture.And also, they don't cut out a lot of the distractions you might hope to lose, like conversations etc..  They just reduce the fatigue of background noise.  If you spend a lot of time on airplanes, don't care much about music and don't care to travel light, perhaps they're a reasonable idea.If they sounded good they'd have 5 stars from me, but they don't, and they're very expensive.Background noise reduction 9/10, distraction reduction 4/10, musical quality 2/10...I'll be sticking with my Etymotic HF5 headphones and sending these back even though they were given to me for free by my employer.  One third the price, small and neat, and for better or worse they act like earplugs - they cut out the background noise *and* conversations leaving only the music, reproduced in a lyrical, textured, detailed way."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Excellent product , would buy again if i get the money. Based on the product title, it is extraordinary in acoustic noise cancelling of course. I don;t have complaint on other aspects."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are certainly great for the traveler who wants relief from engine noise.  Consider, however, those who just want to sit in front of their computers and get away from the world - all the while listening to their favorite Mozart (or insert your own choice of entertainment).  For that purpose, you can't get much better than the QC15s - with outstanding sound and feather-weight comfort. And, if you simply want to get away from it all, you can just ""click"" them on to enjoy the silence.  They really are ""noise cancelling"".  Sure, they don't have the very serious ""cans"" of the more elite headphones, but they do produce top quality sound - and I would challenge the majority of user's ears to find better. As to build-quality, hey don't knock them because they have some plastic components - not everything has to be built of airplane-grade aluminum alloy.  My only gripe (a small one) - don't run out of batteries - or you will be sporting some very interesting earmuffs!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It's really comfortable and good NC technology,a little high in price but I think it's worth it.But it's maybe not as comfotable as AE2,maybe cuz it's NC section"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am not a fan of Bose, I was a little reluctant to purchase these as some reviews say they are have a cheap finish.  But I must say they are very well put together and the carry case is nicely finished.  Noise cancelling is excellent, we have a very loud AC unit in our room, switched the NC on and it just went quiet...amazing. The sound quality is very good also, very surprised.  Expensive? yes, but they are for listening to music in a loud environment... Wish I had purchased these a long time ago."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"What can I say. Bose products cost more , but one gets a lot more than just a product. I owned a pair of Bose noise cancelling head phones that were over 5 years old. The Quiet Comfort 15 replaces the old ones I have. A year ago I snapped the ear muff frame on one side and decided just to glue them...worked for 6 months and the glue gave way. Glued them again and a month later they broke again. I was ready to buy another pair and decided to call Bose to see if they had a replacement program for headphones similar to the Bose 901 speaker replacement that I took advantage of 10 years ago. Score!!!  Bose has a replacement program for my old headphones( Gorilla glue and all) ...they are being replaced by the Quiet Comfort 15s for $99 + applicable sales tax and around $5 shipping."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"...kind of cheaply constructed.I listen mostly to jazz & chill/house & the sound quality is good enough (I like good sound but I'm not an audiophile.)I hear a lot of nuances that I don't notice when playing my iPod Classic through a set of Logitech s715i external speakers.The bass is not quite as heavy as I like but overall the sound quality is good.The lack of bass is not so noticeable with easy listening but when I play something like Led Zeppelin it bothers me a bit.I use an FiiO E5 amplifier (an excellent little amp) to boost the bass to acceptable levels for heavier listening.The biggest gripe I have is the flimsy construction.The battery cover feels like it will break off if you aren't careful.Also where the cord plugs into the headphones it feels a bit weak.With the reputation Bose has for quality; you'd think they would have made these headphones a bit more solid.The comfort factor is good & they are small enough to store in a Swiss Army bag I carry on flights so I don't have to go into the overhead for items I frequently need.These cans will heat your ears up a little bit but not nearly as much as my Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones which make my ears sweat.The cord has volume & track changing buttons which are reasonably easy to use.I've received phone calls on my iPhone while listening to music & had no problems using the controls to switch to incoming calls.Calls are crystal clear & you can still hear your own voice (diminished) as you talk.The buttons are at the top of the cord near the headphones & although I'd prefer they were lower down, it isn't a huge annoyance.You'll need to use a single AAA battery which lasts for quite a while.Unfortunately you can't listen to the headphones without the battery.Overall; I bought these for noise reduction & they definitely excel in this department.I fly a lot & my Audio Technica ATH-M50's allowed entirely too much engine noise through for my listening enjoyment.Granted the ATH-M50's are not noise canceling headphones but if you want premium sound quality & aren't concerned with noise reduction then you should get a pair of the Audio Technica headphones instead of the Bose as they have vastly superior sound quality & they are available at $100 to $125 as opposed to $300 for the QC-15's.==========Update==========I just made my 1st flight with these headphones & WOW; what a difference over the ATH-M50's!These headphones don't get rid of ALL the noise but what they don't filter out is barely noticeable while listening to music.When we were sitting at the gate with only one engine running at idle; I turned the headphones on with no music & almost everything disappeared.I could still hear announcements on the intercom & conversations around me but they were greatly diminished.When I started playing music; I could barely hear the intercom or the conversations of other passengers.I turned on my iPod again as the engines were spinning up for takeoff & heard almost nothing but music!!!It appears as though the noise cancelation works best on continuous sounds like jet engines, etc.Intermittent sounds like conversations or someone using a hammer (the latter rarely happens on an airplane) are subdued but not canceled entirely; which means you'll still be aware of important events onboard like exploding engines or hijack attempts (see comment regarding hammers.)The results are totally acceptable for all but the most finicky audiophiles.Flimsy construction aside; I highly recommend these headphones if you fly a lot!I believe I'll be selling my ATH-M50's on FeeBay!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these before a long international flight and was very impressed.  The sound quality is good, but the noise cancelling is almost magic.  It almost completely eliminates engine noise when on an airplane.  I also use them in my office to eliminate the noise from the large vent directly above my desk.I was also impressed with the various cables and adapters included with the headphones.  The case also includes a small mesh pocket - presumably for extra batteries, but my ipod Nano fits in their perfectly as well."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Got these as a gift for the hubby to use on the airplane.  One thing we figured out about these, they are really just for cancelling ""background"" noise.  In other words, you can still hear the baby screaming two rows back.  We also tried them at home and we could still hear the kids there too--oh well!  Seriously, these headphones are very nice.We are not savvy enough to use, let alone review, the many techincal aspects of these headphones, but we can definitively say they do work...very well!  Blocking out background noise really makes a BIG difference when listening to your music or movies, especially since they are no longer competing with each other.  The headphones also come with a carrying case and an airline adapter, so they are ready to go out of the box.  Additionally, they are quite comfortable to wear, much more so than the headphones that you stick in your ear canal.The downside to these headphones are that they require batteries to use (noise-cancelling or not), they are fairly large, and man, are they expensive!  You really have to be careful not to leave these at security, or anywhere else for that matter, because you would never see them again.  The upside is that if you can afford them and don't mind keeping up with them, they are a nice little luxury to have, especially if you like sleeping on the plane."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If you are looking for a pair of noise canceling headphones look no further!  I just used these on a weekend trip out of state which included plane, train, and bus.  These headphones blocked out everything and let me read, listen to music, and yes sleep in peace.  Consider the $300 an investment in your sanity and saving yourself some of the headaches of traveling. Even when just laying in bed relaxing, these are great to have on to keep out the AC drone or other noises you don't even notice.  As other reviewers pointed out, the bass is not quite the power of a set of subwoofers and the volume isnt the same as an amplified stereo or other amped headphones but still had a couple clicks left in my mp3 and the bass on some songs was enough to feel the shake on my ears.  Crystal clear audio and great noise canceling capability make these a pair of headphones that I will use as often as I get the chance!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I got the headset for travel and to use at work. On the aircraft, it significantly cuts down on the engine noise. Works as advertised! I can listen to movies at normal volume."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I work in a cube city with very loud neighbors. I put these on and they melt away. They are very comfortable, have a long detachable cord, and I use a rechargeable battery that I change every 2 days (I use it at home when watching TV too)."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've had the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones for about a year now.  These are made well with high quality materials.  Noise cancellation is the best in this price range.Battery life (just one battery only) is superb!  I swap out the battery once a month when I use the headphones on average for about 3-5 hours of the day listening to music.  I use these mostly at work but have taken them with me on business and personal trips.  On trips, the headphones come in a sturdy pouch.  The headphones themselves are pretty light and not overly bulky in my opinion.  The cord used to plug into the music device is plenty long.The headphones are very comfortable with supple padding around the ears and along the top of the head.  You can adjust the headphones as you please but, again, the comfort level is very good.  I didn't feel any uncomfortable pressure around the ears or along the top of my head.  Very light as well so you even forget that you have them on at times.One thing I do notice is that because the insulation around the ears is so good, you can tend to sweat inside the ear casing.  This is AFTER 3-4 hours of continuous listening.  I simply put them off for 5-10 minutes and I was fine afterwards for a few hours of additional listening.I'd highly recommend these headphones for the comfort, sound quality, high quality make/durability, portability, and noise cancellation!  The price is high but for what you get, it's worth it in my opinion!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Ok these are expensive and I can absolutely say that they are completely worth it.  It's funny that these come with cards for the product in the case so you can hand them out.  They are reall that good.I've looked, and tried many other noise cancelling headphones.  I'm always on the lookout for something better and cheaper.  I have not been able to find any other noise cancelling headphones that are as good as these.  They work on planes and in my office building(that sounds like a plane due to the air conditioning).I can clearly hear someone if they talk directly to me, but they tune out all other noises.  I travel from the US to India occasionally and these are life savers.I only wish they had a cordless bluetooth version.Hope I don't ever loose these, but if I do, I'm buying another pair."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Let me start off by saying I've used my QC15s for over three years now, including lots of time on flights, and even more on ocean-going ships.  Needless to say, noise-canceling headphones were a great improvement to my happiness-- and these really do cancel noise.  Flip the switch, and instantly everything goes quiet.  If you wear these on a flight, you can slip into your own little first-class world, right in economy class.  No engine noise, and people don't bother you because you are clearly enjoying a very personal sound experience.  They're pretty much great.They come with a hard case, and they are great quality.  They are trimmed with soft, thin leather that, years later, looks as good as new and is soft as silk, so it feels great around your ears.The sound quality is what you would expect from high end headphones.  It's comparable with studio-grade headsets.  The volume is more than sufficient, and like I said above, the noise-canceling is great.  They do require one AAA battery to operate.My first set quit working after a few months for reasons unknown, so I took them to a local Bose store in a mall.  They were replaced right there, no questions asked, and the replacement pair has worked now for over three years.  So 5 stars for customer service.Five stars because noise canceling is a godsend, the quality is great, and these things improve my quality of life like a set of premium headphones should."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tried these because the Sennheiser Momentum didn't fit my ears.  But once you've heard the sound from the SMs, few can compare, and these just didn't stand up in that department.  Otherwise, they were fine.  Good big ear cups, good build quality, can fold for easy storage and travel, and can keep unwanted sound out like no one's business."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I got these because of some recent flights I took.I put these on, and oh boy did they work awesome.Didn't have to hear the constant drone of the airplane noise.I hate airplane noise.They are very comfortable to wear, had them on for many hours and didn't need to take them off.Very well made, and like that one battery lasts a long time."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"During the last month I purchased both the Sennheiser MM 550-X and the Bose QC-15 headphones. My goal was to find a decent pair of noise canceling headphones to block out ambient noise in my office. I'm keeping the Bose, and sending back the Sennheisers. Here is why:1) The Bose fit my large ears much better. The Sennheisers are just a little too small. They aren't as comfortable.2) The Bose noise canceling is much better. It blocks more ambient noise, and there is no perceptible hiss. The Sennheisers hiss a little when the noise canceling is active.3) The Bose sound better at high volumes. The Sennheisers sound a bit harsh.4) The Bose have better base at all volume levels. The Sennheisers don't have nearly enough.5) I hear crackling with the Sennheisers. At first I thought it was a physical flaw, but it appears to be a software problem. Every time I start listening to a new song in iTunes I hear crackling during the first few seconds of the song. After that it sounds ok. While playing back videos in iMovie, there is crackling at certain points in the video soundtrack. The crackling always occurs at the same point in the video. I don't have this problem with the Bose. I think there must be a problem with the audio encoder used by the Sennheisers. I could maybe overlook my other complaints, but this crackling is awful. It's totally unacceptable for a $500 product.6) The Sennheiser noise canceling briefly cuts out each time I stop music playback in iTunes. It turns off for about half a second, and I can hear a click each time it happens. For a brief moment I can hear all of the fans and office noise around me.Anyway, I'm quite disappointed with the Sennheisers. It's a shame, because I really wanted a pair of wireless headphones. It looks wired is the way to go for now. I'm keeping the Bose.I almost gave the Bose a 5-star review. If they came with a slightly longer cable, and a more sturdy cable, then they would easily be 5-star headphones. However, the cable is a tad short, and it's quite thin.  You can't go wrong with these headphones though. They are the best noise canceling headphones I've ever used."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I tend to think Bose products are significantly overpriced. However, I really wanted a quality listening experience. I bought the QC15's in 11/11, after buying/trying a number of alternatives.Pluses:1) Probably the most REALISTIC sound I've heard from headphones. Ever. Bass fiends should look elsewhere. Nonetheless, the bass rumbles, trebles are bright, vocals stand out with very little bias or coloration. Just plain excellent, sound balanced and clear.2) Light and small, probably as small as an over-the-ear model can realistically be.3) Easy to wear for 4 hour stretches since they sit on your skull instead of on your ear structures.4) Noise cancelling is truly effective. Makes the world go away. I have never heard the pumping/breathing others have reported.5) What's especially cool is the sound seems to float in space, as there's virtually no background noise to reference.Minuses:1) Baby this unit. It's reasonably robust, but my impression is designers biased the build toward lightweight and it is more delicate than your average cans.2) Case is ok for normal travel, but not sufficient if a overhead carry on bag hits it.3) You may have to pony up $30+ for cord compatible with Android or Blackberry microphone. Comes with iPhone microphone cord and straight 3.5mm headphone only. I was able to use both with my Android and avoid the extra cost.Other:No AC unit to keep ears cool on hot day.Music dies with battery is a non-issue. How is it to carry extra AAA in the case?"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I love these noise canceling headphones and have been a long time user of a Bose QC2. I recently upgraded to the QC15 and it has the same great comfortable feel with even better noise canceling. I do fly around a fair bit and the Bose are equivalent to a free class upgrade. Definitely worth it for the comfortable fit and wonderful performance. Prior to the QC2 I had tried a number of different options but after my experience with the QC2 I am sticking with Bose.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My last set of Bose QC's was version 2.These are hand's down the best yet.I travel for a living.It's one thing to fly on a plane that has 50 movies; it's another to actually be able to hear the audio.Face it, airline headphones suck; even in first class.These don't."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"They don't come any better.  The main thing to note if you buy a pair is that they come equipped with many of the items also sold separately, e.g., the case."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"As other reviewers have stated, the active noise cancelling does work well.  Background white noise disappears, voices are diminished and become distant.  It is also very comfortable for extended listening sessions.  I do not perceive the ""ear drum pressure"" that some reviewers mentioned.However, for me, sound quality is just as important.  In this regard, the headphones sound decent but not befitting a $300 price tag.  My in-ear monitors,Monster Copper Turbine PRO Headphones with ControlTalk, has excellent detailed sound that is a couples of notches above the Bose, and has excellent passive noise isolation as well."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Tested out the new Beats Studio and thought they sounded great with good noise cancellation.  But then I tried a pair of the Quietcomfort 15 and was blown away by the difference in NRA and sound quality.  Even without the music playing I could immediately hear pure silence (aside from muffled voices) and when I took them off I was amazed at much low end noise there is in my office from the HVAC system and my space heater.  Music quality was also very clear without the heavy bass influencing the songs like the Beats did.  The only negatives I have are that the plastic quality could by better and have a rechargeable battery like the Beats.  I did get the Brown limited edition version and this helps to make it look a little more like the $300 price tag if carries.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones sound great and they have excellent noise cancellation on low-frequency sounds, especially fan noises or airplane noises. However, I intended to study with these but had to return them because unfortunately they do not block out higher frequency noises such as voices or paper shuffling. I wanted these to block out all noise so I could study in a coffee shop, but unfortunately a pair of cheap ear plugs performs better for this function. One thing I do not like about the cables Bose uses is that they are high impedance. I know they have a higher low setting, but even the low impedance setting is quite high and therefore I have to crank up the volume on an iPhone to achieve normal listening levels, I would say about 75 to 100% volume depending on the song. Another gripe I had was that considering the price of these headphones, the plugs or not gold coated so when you rotate the plug in an iPhone or computer, you get some distortion noises common on cheap headphones due to poor contact or transmission. Sound quality is on par with high-quality headphones such as the Dr. Dre beats Pro and Grado SR80i. I would agree with many other reviewers that these headphones have a good bass response but they're not for bass lovers. The bass is accurate, but you cannot really get a booming or bass thumping feel from them. The extra cable for iPhone remote microphone control is excellent, but I did not have an opportunity to test call quality with the inline microphone. The inline remote microphone also work with Apple computers. Unfortunately these did not fill my purpose, so I had to return them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"What can I say? These are as near perfect as can be.  I purchased these for one of my sons a while ago, and he is a real music aficionado, and suggested that I purchase one for my other son.  Since it was close to my birthday, I indulged in one for myself.  All three of us are amazed at the sound of the music, and are also amazed at the fact that all external noise is blocked out.  I can't wait to use these on the plane; and they come in extremely handy when I am sitting in the family room reading while my husband watches TV (with the volume up, nonetheless).So, yes I would recommend them, and yes I would purchase them again (maybe for my third son, even though he is a minimalist and prefers ear-buds. =)One more thing- they came much sooner than expected (in a day or two) in PERFECT condition."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Sound quality is great, however, bass is too low in my opinion.Everyone can hear whatever you are listening too at average volume. I can't use these in a library or anywhere where complete silence is needed.not too happy about the inline mic not working with android (Galaxy s3). Wish bose would just give you the option of which type of cable comes with the headset.For this cable, Only the button works(not the volume rocker). I hear the communication kit works (but no button and that is an extra $30... no thanks).Excited to use it on my next trip! would recommend it for noise cancellation."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I have used it whenever i am traveling. and i also use it whenever i am in the middle of annoying crowded people. LOL no doubt i dont know what they are talking because what i am hearing is the music i am playing on my IPOD. I love this headphone much
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"WOW - what more can I say. This product does as advertised, but so has all of my other Bose products. Background noise is almost completely eliminated when not connected to an electronic device. When listening to anything at all, all exterior noise is gone. I slept like a baby on the 8.5 hour flight to Germany with no tactile discomfort whatsoever. Additionally, if you need to make a phone call in a noisy environment the headphones help with that as well. They come with a cable that facilitates control of Apple products. I'm very satisfied with this slightly expensive purchase. They are worth the price."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I have tried many head phones ... bose QF 15 is the best of all my collections. very comfortable and the noise cancelling function  was very effective. I love using them when I fly and normally I wear it for 12 to 15 hours when travelling. for that price I would say worth the money.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"First off, I'm a headphone person.  I've owned 3 pairs of noise reduction headphones in the last 10 years.  The first pair I owned was a Sennheiser pcx250, which had minimal noise reduction.  After several years of use, I decided to upgrade in 2008 and tried out the Bose QC2 and Sennheiser PCX 450.  The Bose had better noise reduction, but worse sound quality than the PCX 450.  I wanted to like the PCX 450; however, I kept noticing a weird low frequency ringing that would occur while moving my head wile wearing the PCX 450.  Ultimately I kept the Bose QC2 after about a week long trial of the QC2 and PCX 450.Well after almost 5 years of rather regular use of the QC2 while watching TV and listening to my iPhone at home (I live in an apartment) and listening to music on travel, my QC2 headphone pads started to fail.  One of the ear cushions tore due to regular use and the headband pad was starting to peel.  I live fairly close to a Bose factory store, and went in to buy a replacement pair of QC2 ear cushions for $35 (this would have been my second replacement cushion set, I had already replaced them about 2 years ago).  The clerk told me that the failed ear cushions entitled me to an upgrade of my QC2 to a new pair of QC15 for only $99.  I was skeptical, but I went home, got my QC2 and went back to the store and for $99 did indeed trade in my QC2 for a new pair of QC15.  Great deal considering the cushions would have cost $35 alone.On to the review of the QC15 (probably reflected in many other reviews)...  I've been using the QC2's regularly as I stated before, so I can comment directly on the relative improvement of the QC15's.  The QC15 noise reduction is great.  Much, much better than my old pair of QC2 (some of which may be just due to the worn ear cushions).  There is much more noise reduction at low frequencies.  My HVAC noise, which used to be audible with the QC2's, is not audible and footfalls from the apartment above are also not audible while wearing the QC15's.  Given my initial trial of the QC2 and PCX 450's, I can also say that the QC15 noise reduction is likely much better than the 450's as well.  Sound quality of the QC15's is also noticeably better than the QC2's.  Highs are brighter and crisper but lows may not be boosted as much (which I am fine with).  Others may find the lack boosted lows annoying, I do not.  I have not traveled with the QC15's yet, so I cannot comment on their performance on board aircraft.  However, I am guessing they should be rather good.I have a pair of Sennheiser HD 650's at work that I use occasionally to listen to music (they own them so I don't bring them home, spectacular sound quality).  I highly recommend the HD 650's if you don't need noise reduction.  The QC15's don't really compare to the sound quality of the HD650's in a quiet environment, but if you have to listen to music in a moderately noisy environment the QC15's are a good bet.  Overall, sound quality of the QC15's is somewhere in between the QC2 and Sennheiser HD 650's.  I'd bet they are on par with (or very close to) the Sennheiser PCX 450's, but with better noise reduction.  That means, if you are forced to be in a noisy environment, you can listen to your content without as many noticeable distractions."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I finally broke down and bought these after talking about for a year.  It was the best decision ever.  I just used them for the first time on a trip to LA and I'm headed to London today and can't wait to use them.  I find that it helps me arrive at my destination far more refreshed because I don't have the constant noise of the aircraft or the people around me.  Not only do these headphones work, they are super comfortable, which is a win/win.  You won't regret this purchase."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've owned two pairs of the Bose NC headphones. Both failed out of warranty. The first pair the ear pads fell off because the glue failed and became mushy. Called the factory and was told tough,out of warranty. Bad attitude from their employee. I bought a replacement pair and now they have failed-out of warranty of course. For $300 they should last. Some manufactures and I'm not saying this is the case here,deliberately build in a weak part that will fail and force you to buy another one. In this set there is a very tiny wire just inside the battery compartment that is flexed every time the battery is replaced. This wire will fatigue and snap after 50-100 battery change outs. Its another ( got ya) in other wise a good product. Open yours up and inspect the wire. If any of the wire strands are broke try to resolder and good luck.  A maybe fix before it breaks is to carefully coat the wire with Marine Goop. Use a small tooth pick to cover the wire. Goop is available at Lowes in the paint dept.For the built in failure modes I gave this company a 1 star."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I was a division one athlete and was thus required to travel frequently. I used these mostly to allow for sleep on trips. These work great on bus, car, plane (jet and prop) noise cancellation. Even allowed for 8 hours of sleep on a flight to Beijing. The sound cancellation works only on constant noises ie engine noise and allows the user to have a conversation without removing the headphones. When these are used to play music the sound quality is excellent and almost no external sounds can be heard. I have had these two years and have never had an issue with them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these in April - been looking at them for a long time but the $300 price tag put me off for a set of headphones.I have very acute hearing and my husband doesn't.  I wanted to be able to sit with him while he watched television and I could read quietly.  I don't listen to much music so bought it primarily for the noise cancelling feature.  When I read all the great reviews about how these headphones could block out the roaring of a jet engine, figured this was the ticket.My husband put them on and even with his slightly impaired hearing, he could hear the sounds in the house and the television.  It doesn't block out any sounds for me either.I wrote to Bose five or six times and they didn't have any suggestions.  As for the music, I have three pairs of $6.78 EarPollution Plugz - and I don't think the Bose is any better than they are.If anyone has any suggestions as to what may be wrong with this pair we bought, I'd appreciate hearing from you.  I feel like we wasted $300 on something that doesn't have any more value than a throw-away pair.I wish I had something positive to write.  Most of my reviews are 5 stars but I'm going with a 1 on this one.  For those entertaining buying a pair, I'd suggest going to a store to try them before parting with your money.Update on May 27, 2012:Hi, Denia - and thanks for the two other suggestions that replied to my post.I've been emailing back & forth with Bose direct - and one tech support person asked me to try all kinds of things - up to and including running the dishwasher and standing in front of the washing machine. My husband & I both did that - and we had our help who is 1/2 our age do the same - and all three of us could hear the sounds. I thought they would help us and then I received this email from a different person - with a different twist:""Sorry for any confusion. The Quiet Comfort headset is designed specifically for frequent flyers. The technology is desgined to cancel out the constant low frequency tones of an airline engine. It does NOT cancel out every day ambient sounds such as children playing, dogs barking, tv audio, human voices (conversations in the back ground), or anything like that. In fact, I have a pair on right now, and I can hear the two people taking in the cubicle right next to me, very clearly. This is normall (sic).  Now, other customers use the headset for great audio reproduction while listening to their music, but the noise cancellation is designed to cancel out constant low frequency noises. The dishwasher and washing machine sounds are too intermittent to work, that would not tell you anything.Sorry if you thought the headset would work for your individual situation. It won't block out tv audio at all. If you bought the headset directly from Bose, less than 30 days ago, you can return them by calling 800-444-2673.

Big waste of money. Thought if it could block out the sound of a jet engine it would certainly be capable of blocking out the noise of a television set.I'll write to Bose again when ""Barry"" the tech was working and see if he can help me after the 3-day holiday is over.Perhaps putting disclaimer on this item - no where did I read that it was designed exclusively for noise cancelling - only for jets. I'll read the literature again; maybe I missed that section.I'd rate these a 1 if this is the case. $300 is a lot of money to spend on something that says ""noise cancelling"" - but only includes jet engine noise. If that's the case then that should be specifically stated. I'll write to the president of Bose and see if I can get some help from the top. Don't know unless you ask.As for any others looking for ""noise cancelling"" headsets, I strongly suggest going to a store and trying them before purchasing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"What blew me away about these headphones initially was the demo at the store where you s stand under a wind tunnel and this headset deadens the hurricane sound to nothing. For some reason, it's been less impressive in real life.My previous set - a Sony - was absolutely quieter...so quiet that a crying baby in a plane could be shut out.  The Bose headset is comfortable for long durations, more so than the Sony, which clenches the ears and covers the ears more and gets uncomfortable after a couple of hours.The Bose is also useless without a battery. So always have a spare."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones really get you rested well in flight.  I always travel on business class and many business class seats nowadays offer noise-cancelling headphones.  Bose still works a lot better.I also find myself more rested when I have them on.Sleeping in it on a long-haul flight may be a bit difficult because it is quite large.  I sleep on my back but when I turn on my side while asleep, I wake up because the headphones get in the way.I always travel with an extra battery in the case as it could drain fast depending on use."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought a pair of the original Bose noise cancelling headphones in 2004.  They were very good and lasted me 5 years of daily use before one of the arms cracked.  I called Bose and was told I was out of warranty but that they'd sell me a brand new pair of QC2's for 1/3 of the retail cost.  I took them up on it and was very happy for the next 3 years until the foam around the left earpiece came loose.  I called Bose again, and they offered to sell me a set of the QC15's for less than half the retail cost.  To me this felt like excellent service.  I'm very happy.The QC15s are much better than the QC2's.  Noise cancellation is excellent and music sounds great.  I couldn't be happier.  I happily would have paid retail price for these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these a few months ago to use mainly during air travel to listen to my own music (iPhone) and to listen to ""quiet"" on long trips.  These headphone have been a horror story from the beginning.  Bottom line:  they shorted out my iPhone entirely - meaning I've seen that iPhone do everything from displaying a rainbow of colors to just about self-destructing, and the Apple genious folks had a hard time getting it reprogrammed.  I've also had a Bose entertainment system that has been back to the factory 5 times (each time it cost $130 plus shipping) for repairs, the last time being after the power supply shorted and melted and the plastic outer cover ran down my living room wall.  Needless to say, I've had a very expensive lesson - just about a grand - that Bose simply does not build very good stuff!  Most quality companies will make any repair or adjustment necessary to satisfy a customer but Bose apparently does not feel that customer satisfaction is part of a good business plan."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Having owned and used these for a couple months now, I am far from impressed given the exorbitant cost.  I have owned Bose speakers before.  I have purchased three sets of Companion 2 Series 2 speakers for different computers.  I loved those, so I figured I would give these a try and I had high expectations given the price and brand.  First of all, the general build quality is good, however then you get into the cord.  The detachable cord is flimsy and cheap at best.  Honestly I wish there was an option to buy a pair with a fixed cord, they are detachable so you can add the iPhone compatible microphone cable.  Regardless, this cable is cheap.  Second, its hard to get good sound balance from these because of the alternating high/low control on the cord (its on the piece that slips into the headphones).The noise cancellation is average.  What is rather unpleasant about the noise cancelling besides that it only blocks out ambient noise, not voice or direct noise, is that it also feels like its muffling my ear drums.  Its the same feeling as putting in ear plugs and diving underwater, and I don't enjoy it.  It's less noticeable when you're listening to music/movies or playing a game.Also the headphone do not work without the noise cancelling turned on.  That means you need to keep a spare AAA battery with you (required for use) in case the one currently in the headset runs out.Overall, I would probably not purchase these again."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought as a replacement for some stolen ones - bought exactly the same again, no hesitation. they really are good."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My sister bought the QC15 headphones by trading the QC3 in and only paid $100. If she paid the 300, I would give it a three stars. The QC15s block outside noise well, usually drones like a fan or a jet engine's whine are what blocks the best. The sound quality are better than my in-ear Skull Candy headphones. That being said, for $300, I'm confidant in saying you can for sure get better sounding headphones. That being said, these are perfect for traveling since the noise cancelling is good. You could also use in-ear but many don't like them. These however if used as daily use, eats up batteries pretty fast. I can't say on reliability since I've only had them for a month but our family used the QC3 for around 6-7 years and the only issue was the leather ear cups that degraded however it was an easy and cheap fix. I'd rather see these on peoples heads then seeing these over hyped Beats headphones however for $300, get a Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, or Grado.Summary - Great for traveling or noise cancelling applications. If you want to use at home for music, there are better options.Pro - Over the ear is superior, Noise Cancelling works fairly well, no complaints on audio quality, great for travel, good fit.Cons - Not the best for the money, eats batteries, noise leaks out once you go over 20%."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I am Very happy with this headset. Like the fact that it takes a regular battery and lasts a long time. It is very comfortable on the ears and I use them frequently when I travel. These are the best noise canceling headphones I have ever owned which was the reason I bought them in the first place. Other headsets may beat them in sound quality but I am not an audiophile but I still found these to be excellent with my plain old IPOD.  The semi hard case is top notch. You get what you pay for.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Amazing sound quality and the noise cancellation feature is pretty awesome! My first rel set of acoustic noise cancelling headphones and it was worth the money!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Good but not great - you can still hear some noise coming through on an airplane but works very well in a library!
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"A quite expensive, but worth it!The noise cancelling is AWESOME, it cancels almost every sound but not too much the high-pitched noises like women voices but still makes it really low. The only con is that you feel like if you were at the bottom of a pool, weird at the beginning but you will enjoy your music and get used to. Actually the best in the market. Another bad thing is that it will be so quiet and crystal clear that if you have bad quality songs you will know it and hate those songs, you will skip them!Sound is superb, crystal clear and balanced(Maybe not too much bass, if you want bass go with Beats or Rock equalizer). There are some others headphones that sound a bit better but you won't even notice(this doesn't mean these sound bad, actually the sound is pretty good, REALLY good).Construction is plastic is GREAT, i don't have nothing to complain on those headphones about construction they feel really good and strong, just a bit large, but still looks cool. The headphones are big, not for tiny heads like childs even in the smaller size(it will fall off or move). The cable is strong but is a bite long, a bit longer than the normal lenght so you will have to get rid of the lenght. By the way, REALLY COMFORTABLE.Love the AAA battery can replace it really easy, you can buy it everywhere and it's cheap or use an rechargeable one; the QC3 uses an lithium special battery (expensive and you will need to buy an extra one or replace it someday, and if you go out of charge you are done, no more music.)The case is pretty fine, hard but a bit big. I don't even use it, i'm always wearing those headphones. It has a little bag for batteries it has a velcro behind so you can take it down or turn it.You get an extra cable (with remote for apple products), airplane adapter, and a bunch of courtesy cards if someone ask you about these headphones.I don't have complains about the headphones i love them! I've had Senheisser, Bose, Sony, a BUNCH of headphones, normal ones (and in-ear) and cancelling ones.Maybe a bit expensive but worth it. By the way, Amazon customer service was great, i didn't receive the headphones at first, they were really helpful and fast! 1 minute after i opened the claim and was resolved, the send me a new ones! Received them the next day!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I love my quiet times, when I take a break from the noisy, hectic world to focus on what really matters to my soul. It may be painting, meditating, viewing YouTube videos, listening to music... any one of those are greatly enhanced by the use of my Bose noise canceling headphones that my niece bought for me. One of my most highly valued gifts! Great quality, great value - not cheap, but very much worth the investment in yourSELF."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The headphone is more than what I expected, excellent sound quality, real noise canceling, conformable on the ears, great value."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I wasn't expecting a 100% noice cancelling level, but maybe 75-80%... well, I still can heard my neighbors talking, and they're not even screaming... quite disappointed."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'll never fly without these again. Period. There's really nothing else to say, but Amazon is requiring this last sentence."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones distort at high volumes and sound flat when using for playback in a recording studio.They barely reach a satisfactory high volume level when listening to music on an iPhone or iPod.  Even with the high settings on the earphone plug that jacks into the earphone.Noise canceling works well for wanting some quiet while reading.Beats by Dre studio sound incredible on iPhone, iPod and via playback through sound card in my home recording studio, however they too distort but only at the 8 -10 max range on volume; they have a fuller sound from 1-8 volume setting (low to three quarters of the way up)The Bose are comfortable and clear but the clarity and sparkle just isn't there as they are with the beats by dre studios.I'm still a big fan of Bose (surround speaker system) but they need some improvements in tuning these headphones for better sound."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Best headphone I have ever owned but they are severely missing some bass. When I say some I mean some, even a little would be appreciated but they have almost no bass what so ever.The noise cancelling is very effective, on flights I often just have them on with no music playing just so that I can get some quiet.If you listen to music that thrive on good bass then I would not recommend these.But if you don't care about bass then any other headset would be the wrong choice!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I decided to cheap out earlier and bought a pair of Sony NR headsets for $30 and change. They seemed pretty good but on flights, the NR wasn't good enough - way too much background noise. Finally I decided to man up and get the real deal. And boy, what a change (for the better)!With the Bose headsets, NR means NR, they ain't kidding about when they say NR, absolutely no background noise on the flight. My quick thoughts on this so far:- You haven't heard true HD sound if you haven't heard it on this headset.  And the sound is not like bass or treble heavy, it's just crisp and you can hear every water drop and every single instrument being played. And NR works great both ways on this headset - the surrounding noise is almost cancelled out completely for you when you're using the headsets, and the sound of the sound from the headset doesn't carry out of the headsets either. I can listen to music or movies at a fairly high volume and the person sitting next to me won't hear a thing.- The leather trim around the headsets makes them extremely comfortable to wear. I wear them on 15-hour flights and don't feel any strain by the end of the flight. My ears or head don't hurt because of the headsets and the plastic strap. They truly are made for comfort.- It comes with airplane adapter so you can turn it from a single 3.5mm audio cable into one that fits in the airplane sockets. The cable is also detachable completely from the headset, which I actually find very useful when I want to doze off and not be bothered by surrounding noise. You don't realize how effective the headsets are till you take them off and realize how much of background noise they were eliminating!- The only one downside of this headset is that it runs on a AAA battery. So I always need to make sure I have fully charged batteries with me at all times. I carry rechargeable batteries (Sanyo Eneloop are the BEST) with a charger. So if I do run out of battery, I can always charge it on the flight itself. ON a full charge of the Eneloop AAA,  I am yet to run out of battery on a 15-hour flight.Yes, these headsets aren't cheap but they are worth every penny. Bose puts so much research and effort into developing their products, I have absolutely no reason to complain!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I Bought these for noise cancellation and was not disappointed. They are also very durable considering that they are lightweight and comfortable. Since I can't afford a Lexus I just put these on and use my imagination. These were purchased in September of 2009 and the only problem with them so far (April 2012)is the ear pads wore out. Since replacement pads are available from Bose this was not an issue.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had settled for a number of years with another brand which was supposedly nearly as good for roughly half the price.  Yet when I bought these, I realized what I had been missing.  Wore these on flights from Boston to China and back and wear them when I mow the lawn.  Equally useful for either application."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought the QC15's back in 2011 and they continue to produce silky sound just like on day one from the package. That being said, I had to replace the ear cushions (OEMs are roughly thirty bucks). I dont consider this a bad thing or a fault on Bose since the oils from your skin and sweat provide an acidic environment that will degrade these over time and i would much prefer the comfort of these over some other option that does not seal as nicely around your ears.If you want yours to last keep them in the case when not in use, roll the cord, and keep them off the floor.... Dogs love stepping on these, my 53 pound vizsla ran over them at full speed when my wife came home from work once and the momentum shot them a few feet in the air, slamming them into a wall. They didnt break, but very well could of.The noise canceling will save your ears since you no longer have to listen to music, movies, or tv shows at more than 1/3 to half volume to drown out the environment. These are a must for airline travel, especially the horrible experience in traveling internationally. Bring an extra AAA battery for that and yes, rechargeable lithiums work great."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Privacy on airplanes and a far superior noise reduction system make these headphones my new favorites.Despite being a bulky package for carry-ons. I find this works well on airline sound systems as well as with my i-Pad.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I decided to try them for the 30 days.  1 flight I was hooked.  Noise pollution greaty diminished.  Changeable battery is the way to go, seems to last a long time."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have made several trips from Dallas to Dubai and these made the trip much better.  15 hours in a plane...painful.  They work much better than others tested or tried.  Not the best for HF listening normal use, but on a plane...#1."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Using these while running on a treadmill and the difference is amazing. I don't have too turn the volume up so loud anymore. The noise canceling technology is really amazing. I've also used them for traveling by airplane. Even if you're not listening to music, you can still turn on the noise canceling feature and quiet things down a good bit. I don't fly without these anymore!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My 3rd set of Bose Noise canceling.I have the QC3 (stays in my office) and QC2 (now relegated to the gym) - they both still work superbly.  Albeit, I have replaced the ear pads on them using 3rd party materials (see my other feedbacks for details), the replacement pads are not great - but good (4/5) enough for intended use.  I've had the QC15 for about a month now - using them sparingly and awaiting my overseas trip in a few weeks.  Having owned the QC2 & 3, the 15s are so much better - both, in sound quality and nose canceling (NC).  Side by side comparison QC2 vs QC15 - the QC15 NC system performs supremely better.  I'll spare you `geeky' details - and I'm not a `snooty' high fidelity guru - but I like good quality stuff.  I purchased these for $270 (Aug 2013) - If you are in the market for something less expensive but acceptable in sound quality and NC (my opinion - and personal recommendation) check-out the `Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B QuietPoint Active $140).  The AT's are not the same standard as Bose, albeit from a budget perspective.""Enjoy YOUR music... don't fret what others think""!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I keep forgetting to press button on headphone to turn the device OFF and so batteries are gone in 1-2 days... what a stupid design. Why cant they detect when it's put on the ear and turn batteries off by itself.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these headphones from Crutchfield instead of Amazon, only because they don't charge sales tax on orders to New York State. As for the headphones themselves, they do an incredible job at noise cancellation and are wonderful when used for listening to music. A lot of people have mentioned that they don't provide enough base, but to me they seem just fine. The noise cancellation is the main reason why I purchased them, as I like to sit outside on a balcony that's somewhat close to the road. They almost completely eliminate the noise of cars going by. The only comment that I can make regarding these that may be a concern, is that I suspect Bose will be introducing a newer version within the next 18 months. The latest version was introduced in 2009, with minor upgrades for use with Apple products in 2011. I called Bose to ask if they would be coming out with a newer model anytime soon, and as expected they declined to answer my question. Based on this model(with the exception of the 2011 upgrades) being 3-4 years old, I'm guessing that a newer one will be offered soon. As for now, these are the best noise cancellation headphones on the market."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am so VERY glad I bought these.  I really wanted to find some means to get some rest during plane travel where there's always loud talking people and screaming babies.  So I evaluated a number of noise cancelling headphones and I ended up buying these.I was given the ideal conditions to test these wonderful headphones.  I was on a 4.5 hour flight with people chatting very loudly, and the primary test was provided the very healthy baby sitting in the lap of the parent just behind my seat.  The inconsolable baby in the seat just behind me provided quite the stress test of noise against these headphones.  The unfortunate child provided consistent outbursts of screaming just behind my seat.  These headphones cut the overwhelming majority of that sound and I was able to rest (up until the point where the baby started kicking the back of my seat while on the parent's lap).IMPORTANT NOTE:  From my own experience, it seems no set of noise cancelling headphones absolutely blocks 100% of noise.  That is unrealistic.  However, these did a very fine job in cutting the sound to the point where it was trivial and made it easy for me to rest or at least relax.I did not have to blast the sound of my music in order to drown the obnoxious talkers around me or the screaming baby.  The headphones worked magnificently and I am glad for every dollar I paid for these.  I will never fly without these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I had the predecessor of this product and frankly although the build quality seems to have improved as-well as the weight of the product (feels less flimsy); The same could not be said in terms of audio quality which seems to have decreased. The noise cancellation abilities are better however and many background sounds that used to leak into the previous model no longer do so.*edit* Although I also own the Bose MIE2 Mobile headphones (for over a year now) which work with both Android and iPhone; the microphone that comes by default with the Quietcomfort 15 does not work with my Android even though it works with my laptop (which is not a macbook). This might be an issue with my phone (I will update once I look into it further).*edit* Bass is definitely worse than predecessorConclusion: Total disappointment from predecessor; This is by far the first product I have not enjoyed from Bose. Feels like a downgrade rather than an upgrade.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought these for my mom who travels a lot.She seems to really enjoy the noise cancelling.I also had a chance to test them out and here is my opinion.(I also own a pair of Monster Beats Studio)Pros-Excellent Noise Cancellation-Less sound leakage than the Monster's (but there is some at the loudest volume)-Clean, crisp sound (Quality you would expect from a Bose)-Extremely comfortable and better build quality (compared to Monster Beats)-Design and Packaging is superbCons-I do like to listen to bass heavy music also, so the bass wasn't as deep and heavy as the Beats (which is expected)-Price (I know I also have the Beats, but I'm just saying $300 is a lot to drop on headphones)If you can afford it and need good noise canceling headphones, I would recommend them.Just an opinion from an everyday person."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Okay, for years I've wanted the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, but I kept buying cheap, and not so cheap knockoffs. I must have 4 sets of noise-cancelling headphones in a rubbermaid tote labelled &#34;headphones&#34;. Finally, before my last trip, I just went for it. What a difference! I wasted a lot of dough on the rubbermaid tote phones, but I've found my thrill at last. And the case they give you for storing the phones is awesome. 6 stars!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I used these QC15 headphones for the 1st time yesterday on a cross country flight.  How I ever got along without this device is beyond me!  It's the 1st time in my 47 years I was actually able to watch the in flight movie and enjoy it.  Phenominal sound with my iPhone, too.  It's like I was in my own private, little shell within coach seating.  Definitely worth the price!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am on my second set, just because I wanted to get a second set.  I have own these for awhile now.  Amazon didn't use to sell them, but I glad they do now.  My main. main, main reason I got these is because I tend to be a little rough on headphones (by accident) and I got tired of paying $30-40 and having shoddy headphones.  I am reviewing this not because of it's noise cancellation but it's ability to let you listen to crystal clear sound.  Love it.  I listen to my iPhone/iTouch with these.  And the sound is incredible.  You hear all the bass, trebles, horns, rich voices you really want to hear.  It makes the music very very personal as if you are in the world's best concert.  I also use them on my home theater and wow, it brings the base and distributes the sounds as if you are listening to it in surround sound.  I also used them on my computer and it sounds great also for gaming, tunes, etc.  Plus, there is a microphone accessory so if you get a call, you can speak to the other person and trust me, wearing these while using your iPhone, you will never mistake another word.And they are extremely durable.  Many times I have fallen asleep wearing these or I get a little entangle and the cord just pops right out of the headphones (designed to do that), so no more frayed or torn wires where you can only hear one side.  It is practically impossible to damage that cord from it getting caught on something.  The only tiniest drawback is that it runs on batteries (one single AAA), but that doesn't matter.  It is soooo worth it.  I normally get the Energizer Lithium/Ultimate batteries (silver color).  A little more expensive, but they last longer than just generic AAAs.  There is an on and off button on the side (the noise cancellation button), so you can always turn it off to save battery (when you aren't using it).  Also there is no noise leakage from these when you are wearing them, so you will not be disturbing your fellow citizens.Oh and I do wear these when I am flying (normally listening to music) and they shut off the entire world.  Makes it a more pleasant flight.I also want to say something about the noise reduction aspect of these headset.  It works.  It may not block out all the noise, but it blocks out a good portion of it.  I think they are better design than Dr. Dre the Beats (the other $300 headphones).  Listen, $300 dollars is a lot for headphones and I thought I would never ever be that person that would spend that type of money on something like this, but it is soooo worth it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"&#8220;Wide range of frequencies&#8221; is what&#8217;s written in Bose QuietComfort 15 documentation. Much of this high-tech headphone is proprietary, I don&#8217;t think even patented. But the price difference between a $30 noise canceling headphone and this one has a lot to do with this &#8220;wide range&#8221;. The former could be canceling a single frequency, and still call it &#8220;noise canceling&#8221;&#8212;legally. But you can simply hear the difference. I think the QC15 goes beyond calculating the inverse of a frequency to zero noise. It actually listens to the music you&#8217;re listening to and doesn&#8217;t cancel the frequency that is part of the music. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t detect any reduction in quality of the music while all the noise has been silenced. That&#8217;s also a lot of computation processing very fast. I tested this thing right next to a loud air conditioner and I still heard the loud silence the moment I turned on the headphone. It&#8217;s remarkable and almost magical because I don&#8217;t fully understand the technology behind it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I also wanted to try out some noise cancelling headphone so I headed to my local store and tested out these BOSE and a pair of BEATS. They both sounded good but I felt that the BOSE was a little clearer and the build quality was better. I decided to order them on Amazon because they got the best price. ^_^ I got the headphones today and decided that I must write a review for a product this good.I put the headphones and turn the noise cancelling button on and honestly I wasn't impressed. I thought I wasn't gonna hear the background noise with the noise cancelling on and the audio jack disconnected. It seemed like everything was filtered and all I could hear was my TV playing. Anyways, I just added this because I wasn't impressed at first.Later at night, I turned the headphones and plugged it into my ipod. I have to say that it I was very impressed with the audio quality. The sound was incredibly clear. I loved the vocal quality when listening to new Bon Iver CD. I wasn't expecting the headphones to have a lot of base because there Acoustic headphones but the base is damn good. I have to say that the headphones can bump when your listing to rap music. I mostly listen to Alternative, Rock, Rap, and Reggae and these headphones sound perfect on every genre that I tried it out.The only negative thing I can find is that my ears will sweat so I usually take the headphones for a little after an hour or two of listening to music. Other than that. These headphones are solid build and the sound is crisp and clear. Owning these headphones makes me want to re-listen to my whole music library again."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am so happy with my new headphones by Bose! They have very good noise canceling when you just have on that option, but WOW do they do a great job at noise canceling when you're listening to music or TV shows! They've been a real God sent for me because of my sometimes noisy upstairs neighbors. But now when they're walking around a lot, running their dishwasher, or running their washing machine, I can totally block them out when I am trying to watch my TV shows. I should have gotten these headphones a long time ago. And I just had to replace the battery, but that was a great experience too. The power light was blinking for a day or two, and I just kept using them. And when the battery finally died, the sound cut in and out, and then there was no more sound, so I knew that I had used up all of the battery power, and it was a good feeling knowing I pushed the battery as far as it could go. It would be nice if Bose could make a wireless option, in this day and age where more and more things are going wireless."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It's fine.  I used it for my international 14 hour trip.  It was comfortable, but I felt it didn't cancel as much noise that I like.  I'm not an audiophile whatsoever so I couldn't tell the big difference in sound between these headphones and another pair that I use at home.  Would I buy these again?  Prob not unless they go down in price.  I should have tried out other noise-cancelling headphones, but felt these were #1 due to reviews and I needed something immediately for my trip.  I suggest people try out different types of headphones before plopping down $300."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,honestly cannot live without them and wouldn't change them for anything great and comfy and everything is so clear to hear
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is Mr. Skeptical here... I almost over-thought this item because to me it seemed a little pricey, I am retired and on a fixed income. These Headphones do everything that you had hoped for them to do. Big time noise reduction and a great headphone. You can use them for noise reduction only if that is what you want, but they make my MP3 player sound great. Definitely a quality product.  Your turn to ""step up""..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these specifically for the noise-cancelling feature for air travel, despite some negative reviews about long-term wear.Although they worked well off-plane, on flights I found them invaluable. I now count them among my ""necessities"" for air travel.  I don't have any way to compare them with other noise-cancelling phones, nor have I had these for more than a month, but let me say that I watched several movies on a 12 hour flight and never removed them. The audio on the movies came through crystal clear.  Between movies I napped in relative ""silence"".  I saw two other ""commuters"" on a long flight wearing the same phones without a wire.  You don't need external audio input to enjoy the benefit of noise-cancelling.It is only when you remove them that you realize just how terribly noisy it is on an airplane. I don't know if there is a connection, but since I have used the headphones I have not experienced my usual headaches. In any event, noise- cancelling headphones are miraculous, and Bose has to be among the best.  It is ALMOST like sitting in a quiet room, very peaceful, and well worth the investment."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"+Very Comfortable+Noise cancellation a great feature+Comes with nice carrying case&#62;Uses AAA Battery not rechargeable, you can put a rechargeable eneloops and works but I would not trust any other brands just in case they leak acid.-Expensive-Only work on iphone ipod does not work on any android. The mic and volume buttons are useless-Does not work without power, so its on with sound isolation and your music or no sound at all-Battery compartment very snug, every time I change the battery it feels like I can accidently snap off the lid-Does not block all sounds, only repetitive / white noise sounds."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have been traveling a lot for the past 2 years and its literally been that long that I have been agonizing over this purchase.  If you are reading reviews you are probably in the same boat I was. $300 for head phones??  Its a tough one for sure.  Let me put it this way, even if you travel once a year its worth it.  Most trips I have taken I want to strangle someone, not sure why people are such retards when traveling, but I am just trying to get from point A to Point B.  The more you travel the more it gets amplified.  I could see where someone that can use these at work would be very happy with these too.  Bottom line is I wish I had bought these 2 years ago.I bought some cheaper noise canceling headphones from Sony (MDR-NC7) and I have some decent in ear headphones from Sony also.  The in ear block out as much noise as the noise canceling ones so the noise canceling ones from Sony where a waste of money.  Not only do they not perform the noise canceling function very well they also sound very weak.  Now keep in mind that I am comparing $40 headphones with $300 ones.  I never expected the $40 ones to do as good as the Bose but seriously, if you just get some cheap in ear head phones you would be just as well off.Noise Cancelation:The test at Best Buy with specific noise (Jet noise simulated) at the Bose display is astounding to say the least.  I agree with several other reviews that the Bose head phones seem to pick particularly easy frequencies to block and it is most certainly aimed at lower range.  I first tried these while watching a rather loud movie and I felt that gave me a much better representation of what to expect in an airport or airplane while traveling.  Most noise was blocked and the voices where lowered a great deal, with music at medium levels most of the noise was blocked out.  From what I read on the Bose website there is a Mic on the outside AND the inside of each cup.  You can read up on the specifics, I can tell you that it does a very good job.Sound Quality:I saw several complaints in reviews about the sound and all I can say is its Bose.  I have a Bose stereo in my car and immediately had to replace the speakers.  I totally expected the same mediocre sound quality with the headphones.  Decent sound that is brought to you from the cheapest drivers they could get away with.  Profit driven?  You bet.  Unfortunately with headphones there is not a darn thing you can do about it.  Personally I am happy with the sound but know I should be getting a ""Little more"" for my $300.  Because of the noise canceling you don't have to cut the volume up as high as you would without to hear details as clearly.  For me the overall sound is very good but its no Dr. Dre's either.Construction Quality: ****Update below \/ \/ \/ *****I have not had these long enough to know about defects or short comings.  I appreciate the fact that the head phones come with a decent case and I think the overall feel is ok.  I have seen a few people ram these into the seat back while on a plane and a back pack before, I suppose these are the people complaining about the head phones falling apart.....imagine that.  I understand how someone paying $300 for head phones and having it break right away could be frustrated but take that with a grain of salt.Package includes:Head Phones (Can be used without a wire for just noise cancelation)Semi-hard Shell caseWire for regular mini plug connection wth High/Low settings for Airplane adapter useWire for Iphone/Ipod/Itouch use (Has same features as OEM Apple ear phones, i.e. volume up, down, pause buttons and built in mic)2 prong to 1 Airplane Adapter1XAAA Battery (MAKE SURE YOU PACK A SPARE AAA) you can not use the headphones to listen to music with out a batteryWarranty bookInstructions in many languagesUPDATE ######  07-05-2012  I have had these headphones long enough to add additional comments on the construction quality.  I strongly urge people to use the semi-hard shell case to carry your headphones.  I took one trip that I had very limited room to carry my case so I left it in my luggage.  I will never do that again.  I see clearly now how people break these while traveling.  Its not practical to wear these the entire trip especially when its 100 degrees outside and parked in a plane for an hour on the ground, this exact situation happened to me so I put them as gently as I could in the seat pocket but I almost broke them taking them out.  Just bring the case and deal with it.  Keep in mind you are buying cutting edge technology headphones that sounds decent and cancel a majority of outside noise....not indestructible headphones.  They are not butterfly wing fragile but I could not see a single failure point either that would have me overly concerned.Since my purchase Dr. Dre has come out with noise canceling headphones for about the same price.  Personally I would buy those instead after listening to them but all in all I am still happy with my purchase.  By far the best money I ever spent for traveling.  My last trip there was a totally annoying child screaming his lungs out and all I could do is put my headphones on before take off and cut them on (I could care less when the flight attendant said)  I played music at the highest clear volume and was smiling away as I looked around and saw one after another passenger's face filled with disgust and aggravation.  The trick is to point the LED AWAY from the flight attendant side and just tell them it is off and they will leave you alone.  To be clear, the highest undistorted volume on this headset is probably 60-70% of the Dr Dre's.  Good thing is it can drown out pretty much anything.  Another good thing is you did not have to have it at unsafe levels for total sound blockage."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Having used these headphones for three months i feel it is enough time to leave a competent review. I bought these headphones because everyone raved about the sound, comfort, and noise cancellation.SOUND: I want to start by saying i am a regular guy that likes music and radio. I am not a professional, an audio engineer or anything of that sort. Do these headphones sound good? Yes. Do they sound noticeable better than a cheap set of ear buds? Yes. Is it something that will blow you away and change the way you listen to music? Not really. In other words, these sound good and they are fun to listen to, but the way some people make it sound you would think it is astronomically better. They are not. There is one thing i have to say about these headphones, they are not good to listen with cell phones. I have tried them with a Samsung Galaxy S3, an LG G2 and an LG Optimus F3. The volume is not as loud as it should be. I like my music loud and these guys don't deliver in that aspect when you are using these with a cell phone. I hooked them up to my desktop and the sound is much louder and richer. It could be that the audio card on the desktop computer is better.NOISE CANCELLATION: One of the biggest plus in these headphones. The noise cancellation is awesome. It is amazing how much sound these guys block out. For the past six months i had construction making terrible noise outside my house. When I put these guys on i can't hear anything. Sounds like lawn mowers, drills, car engines and microwaves go away without any problems. It doesn't block everything though. For example, voices are only blocked marginally. Once you put the music at least half way you will not be able to hear anything. On more than one occasion i have missed delivery packages because of these. You are in your own world when you put these on with volume over 50%.PACKAGING: These headphones come in a pretty nice case that offers very decent protection. They fold flat on the case which makes it very convenient if you want to take it on the road in a backpack. Along with the carrying case comes two audio cables. They are fairly skinny cables that are considerably longer than your regular Apple ear buds. I really hate how the cable gets tangled very often with chairs or other objects when i am walking around the house using the cell phone.  One of the cables comes with volume control but it doesn't work with Android phones. The middle button pauses/continues the songs though. If you triple press it quickly it skips to the next song. I am surprised that the cable has held up so well considering i keep pulling and tangling it every day.CONSTRUCTION: I seen a lot of people bashing the construction of these headphones. The headphones are not made of indestructible metal, they are made of plastic. That is not to say that it is bad though. I have accidentally dropped the headphones from my hands to the floor in more than one occasion. The headphones are still intact. I also like that the headphone band is very flexible. A lot of time i like to only listen with one ear and place the other cup a little behind my ear. Like i said, it is flexible so it doesn't break or anything. The band on the middle is made of leather which makes it feel premium. Personally, i like it a lot. The only thing that has me worried about these headphones is the little door that opens up so you can insert the battery. It is also made out of plastic and i am afraid the plastic might get fatigued after a couple of years of use. The actual door that i am talking about is like the ones in TV remote controls that have the little snap sound once you close it. If it ever stops snapping correctly i fear it can stop the sound completely since the headphones do not work without the batteries. The construction could be improved but it is not nearly as awful as some other people make it out to be. If you treat them carefully they are going to last.COMFORT:  The plastic construction makes the headphones very light on the head. I have tried other headphones that weight considerably more and it just becomes painful to use after more than an hour. I bought the Beats by Dre Studios and i returned them after a couple of days because how heavy they felt. The size of the cups were small too. I had days where i used the QC15 for more than 4 hours in a row without feeling any discomfort. Actually, i will go ahead and say it, these are the most comfortable set of headphones i used in my life. If you want to use headphones for extended use, these are it. The cup size are pretty big and they fit my ears perfectly.BATTERY LIFE: I use a set of 1.2V rechargeable batteries to power these headphones. I use it an average of 3-4 hours a day. Each battery last me an average of 1 week. The right cup shows a blinking light that warns you a few hours in advance when the battery is running out. If you are planning to use the headphones a lot consider purchasing a set of rechargeable batteries. You will go through about 4 batteries a month. I don't think the 35 hour estimate made by Bose is accurate. I feel it is closer to 20-25 hours. But then again i have only tried them with rechargeable batteries.In conclusion, i like these headphones a lot. The only reason why i don't give them 5 stars is because they are very expensive ($300) and because they require the use of batteries. It would have been great if they could be used without batteries even if the noise cancellation didn't work. The sound is a considerable improvement over regular ear buds. The comfort and noise cancellation are the best i ever seen in a set of headphones. I have no problem recommending these headphones if you can stomach the high price though."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are my second pair of Bose I've owned. I had the QC2 before this pair, and I can tell you, BOSE ARE THE WAY TO GO! The quality of music, every tap of a drum, ever breath the artist takes, is so crisp and sharp. You don't have to blare your music anymore to hear how good it is. The noise cancelling is great at cutting out chatter for people and particularly good at removing the rumbling noises from jet engines while flying and the road and engine noise while in a car or bus.Really though, I cannot recommend Bose headphones enough! I love them more than my 5.1 surround sound from my computer. In all seriousness, if you're willing to put down $300 on headphones, you'd be a fool to get anything other than these. There are some very small companies that have better systems, without the noise cancelling, but for more than twice the price, not to mention, if they break, that's on you. With Bose, I have had only one issue over the past 6 or so years of owning a product from them, and I can tell you that their customer support is phenomenal. Immediate replacement of my headphones, no cost to me. No questions asked.If you are willing to spend $250 - $450 on a pair of headphones, there is no better option in that price range than these QC15's. They are truly a remarkable piece of technology and I cannot stress enough just how great both the build and sound quality are."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Words cannot describe how great these headphones are.  They were a lifesaver on the plane and I some of the best money spent.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had the luxury of experiencing the Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones on a recent international flight. Noise cancellation is impressive; the sound of the aircraft virtually disappeared even without music playing. I ordered a pair of these headphones the day I returned from my trip.My point of comparison is my set of Shure sound isolating earbuds (current model SE315). For years I was impressed with their ability to block outside noise while allowing me to enjoy a movie or music. The Bose headset takes noise cancellation to a whole new level.The tradeoff is ""bulk"". I always carry two sets of Shure earbuds in my travel case so I and my wife can watch movies during flights. Carrying two full-sized headphones is less convenient plus I suspect the headphones are more prone to damage.Whenever space allows, I'll carry the Bose headphones and enjoy their superior noise cancellation. When packing light, I'll carry the Shure earbuds."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are arguably some of the best headphones in the world.  Bose invented noise cancellation, so obviously this is top notch.  Audio quality is superb, as expected from Bose, clean clear sound top to bottom, no over accentuated bass and/or treble frequencies, that's not the way to really listen to music, Bose has it right, unlike some other popular brands. Finally exceptionally light weight, comfortable and durable.  As long as Bose keeps doing what they're doing (or gets better), I'll never own headphones from anyone else.  If you want to test them, find a Bose store.  Buy these, you won't regret it."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchase other headphones (Beats, Sony, Soul) but quickly realized that I should have listened to what all the reviewers said about the Bose.  Just because the others are similar in price doesn't mean they are all the same.There are several variables in my decision.  1). The size of the case is much better when fitting into a laptop bag. The cases for the Soul and Beats were huge and not very flat.  The Bose is flatter by far.  2). Sound bleed was very bad on the Soul and the Beats and Sony.  If I sat next to someone while wearing these, they would not be happy because they could hear the sound too.  Not good for others. It seems the Bose are better about preventing sound leaks around the ear cups.  3). Comfort.  The Bose felt lighter on my head for extended periods of time although the others were not uncomfortable.  4).  Sound was more than fine for my needs on the Bose when listening to podcasts, audio books and music.  I suppose you might argue that the Beats or Soul are a tad better for music, but that might be true only for certain types of music.  Noise canceling function works extremely well on the Bose and imam writing this after having used them for several overseas flights.  5). Price.  Not as much a concern for me since the others i tried were similar  in price.Try them.  You'll keep and enjoy them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I decided to invest in a pair of these or similar to cut out the noise around cubicles at work when I want to focus on something. I am easily distracted. A friend of mine had a Dr. Dre Beats headset which is the same price, so it was between this and the Beats.Here's my observations and basis for a 4 star review:- Background noise cancellation: works perfectly - they seem to have perfected the art of cancelling out the background hiss of ambient noise or white noise, if you can call it that.- Used them on an aircraft, and they were great at cutting out the engine roar- I've tried the Dr. Dre's as well and the Bose QC15 is superior in this area.- As far as the fit and comfort go - i'm neutral, as I've not tried on too many other headphones like this- Why this review is 4 stars and NOT 5 stars: As far as the noise cancellation goes, they do not do a good job of cutting out voices or any other noise outside background hiss. This part of noise cancellation seems to be missing. Overall, the sound of people talking is far reduced when the headset is turned on, but without playing music, you can still hear people talking in the background, even if they aren't very loud."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Summary: mediocre microphone, comfortable for all-day wear, suggest rechargeable batteries for daily use.I use these in the office mostly and for occasional travel. The noise cancellation is really great while traveling, but get a headset with a more directional mic if you plan on using it for phone / Skype calls. Unfortunately the mic hangs facing away from your mouth, picking up other people and room noise. My office is not extraordinarily loud, but in order to use this as a headset, I must hold the mic directly in front of my mouth with one hand and have the other hand ready with the mouse to mute/unmute the mic.I recommend rechargeable AAA batteries. I go through about 1-2 every weeks, depending on how much I use them for music. The 35-hour estimated battery life seems accurate."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have to admit the 17 1/2 months I've used these headphones (almost daily) they have been stellar - perfect noise blocking on trips, helpful for concentration on sticky work projects; great sound quality on all types of music - absolutely no complaints...until (insert 1950's horror discovery noise here) the left earphone started fading in and out and then finally gave up the ghost a day later.  Replacing batteries, praying to the audio gods didn't work - they were dead and the warranty had expired (only 12 months).  Online searches for people with a similar problem found little help from BOSE - evidently they are solid state and cannot be ""fixed"".  Should I contact them and see?  In this day, it's rare to see or hear of companies standing unwaveringly behind their products - can you prove me wrong, BOSE?"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are rated pretty high, but not from anyone who has owned a pair of them for a significant period of time. So let me fill you in on some serious quality issues I have seen after owning a pair for about 6 years (in the order the events occured). Mind you I have always babied these things and kept them in the hard case, so thats why I find this particulary disturbing (well, that, and the fact that they cost $300).1. About 3 years ago, as I was adjusting the headband, I noticed that the plastic had broken where the two pieces slide into one another. It was bad enough that crazy glue was not an option. So I contacted Bose fully expecting to be able to get them repaired or replaced for a reasonable fee. No such luck. The Bose rep told me I could purchase another pair, period. He may have offered a discount, but it must not have been a very good discount because I recall ripping him a new one for such bad support. I was going to throw them away, but I took one more look at the damage and decided the try to fix the broken area with some tightly wound electrical tape. This worked well enough, so I kept them, determined to get a few more months out of them.2. About a year ago I noticed that the on/off switch was intermittant. You have to push extra hard to the right to get the red light to come on. Wierd, but I can live with that.3. This past weekend I placed the headphone earpieces down on my dads fine wood clothing bureau and when I picked them up a few hours later I noticed that some of the soft cushion had stuck to the wood! It appears that the cushion is deteriorating!! There were little black cushion bits everywhere. There was nothing on the wood surface to cause this, except possibly for some very light wood polish.Now, these things would be forgivable if this was a cheap pair of headphones, but this is BOSE for gosh sakes, and these cost $300! Whats up with that? You buy a brand like Bose precisely becuase you assume the quality after 6 years will be excellent, not just fair or good.So, yes, the sound quality is very good. And I am sure they have made some design changes in the past 6 years. But the overall quality of the pair that I have is  most certainly NOT good. Have they addressed all of these issues in the current model? I have no idea. The BOSE rep did not tell me about if they did. But based on my experience I am very dissapointed in BOSE and will never again waste my hard earned money on a pair of thier headphones again. There are plenty of other noise cancelling headphones out there that are just as good, for alot less $$. My advice is shop around and consider this review before you fork over big bucks for these headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I listen to classical and high fidelity orchestrated music. When I'm feeling really good I listen to trance, ambient techno, and so forth - the QC15 neve, EVER disappoint. Although I have I have wanted more BASS it is not the fault of the phones but the hardware. These phones will expose the quality of your hardware very fast. Be careful not to blame them for the hissing and so forth as it is almost always the hardware the BOSE QC are connected to.I see so many young people with these DR Dre phones on and I have used them - you have no idea the amount of BASS and treble the BOSE can produce that will destroy the Dre's (yes at a +$100 difference) if the hardware allowed you to up it. Hands down the quality and FIDELITY are off the charts. Always have a single spare AAA on hand bont dont stress out - the battery lasts about 3-4 weeks and that's using the QC 15's daily (for a total of about 40 hours non stop).The only complaint I have is that for $300 the QC 15's come with a fairly cheap cable. I got a year off mine, including traveling on a weekly basis before it started coming apart. They needed to have a braided cable like the monster cables do or something (the cable does not allow for poor audio quality so dont worry).  other than that the phones are a MUST HAVE.I highly recommend them to anyone who flys alot."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I finally broke down and bought the Bose headphones.  They are definitely much more comfortable than my $140 Sony MDR-NC200D Digital Noise-Canceling Headphones, which makes my ears hurt after a half hour or so.  Bose also does a way better job at cancelling out the jet engine noise than the Sony.  The headphones come with a flat hard plastic case and the ear pieces twist flat to fit in the case.  Initially, I thought the case would be too bulky for my backpack, but the flat design does make it easier to pack and protects the headphone.  I guess I should mention that the sound quality is really good."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I can't say enough positive things about these headphones. They are so comfortable and put you in a bubble of silence. I wear them at work, no music playing, just to block out coworkers. Highly recommend. I've wanted them for years and they totally live up to their hype!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The noise cancellation was incredible, and the sound quality was very good.  But $300 for a pair of wired headphones is too much.  The stock picture is misleading because it doesn't show a wire.  Bose should have built in wireless capability to these headphones as an option.  I tried using them around the office and the wire was always in the way.  I took them back.I also noticed:- No battery, no music- No auto shut-off, so don't forget to flip the switch or your battery will run dead- An obnoxious clicking sound when the battery runs dead"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have owned these wonderful Bose headphones for a couple of years now and use them several hours a day. They are still going strong.  Here are some pro's and con's:THE GOOD- The sound spoils me. Really. It is hard to tolerate listening to music with any other lesser speakers (not just headphones).  Indeed, with these, One hears nuances in my music that I did not notice before. The way I would describe the music is CRISP, deap and spacious.- Noise canceling is excellent. I am disabled after suffering brain trauma and  cannot tolerate much noise nor commotion around my home - yet I have three small kids!  These Bose save the day; all-day and everyday. I can block out most of the noise with the noise canceling just turned on without music. When the rest of the noise needs to disappear, I simply play some light music from my iPad. The world magically becomes completly silent. love them!- They are extremely light and comfortable. I can wear them for hours a day with very little fatigue. These are the only over the ear headphones which I have owned that do not rub my ears and cause irritation.- I love that e cord easily detaches from the headphones so that I can take advantage of the noise canceling without chords.THE BAD- They do create a practically airtight seal which causes a weird air preassure change that you feel. Wearing them with the noise canceling turned on thus has an effect on your ears as though you were swimming a few fear under water. I have gotten use to it but it took me a few days. Everyone whom I have had tried he headphones, notices this air preassure change. Yet, they tolerate it because they are blown away by the noise canceling and the quality of sound.- The only other con is that they do cause my ears to heat up and slightly sweat. I find that I need to take the headphones off every 30 minutes or so, just to give my ears a breather for a few seconds.In short, these bose QC 15's come highly recommended. If your purchase them, I can pretty much gaurentee that you will enjoy them and feel that they are well worth the money."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I've had a pair for about 10 years. These are the best NC headphones overear! I brought a second pair just to have the blue. Purchased the QC20i and I don't think they comparing well.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I tested these at Bose but the price they wanted was much higher than what I paid. The noise cancelling is so good. I put them on while off then turned it on and the 1st time about 60% less noise. Now after about 3 weeks it more like 90% of the noise is now gone and seems to keep getting better. Also it has no problems with the highs or lows sound. it is so clear and comfortable to wear. I will buy the cordless to see if it just as good in a few years.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I recently broke my old Sony's so I decided to try these to despite the stupidly high price. I have to say the headphones are amazing and I can't find any complaint at all. Except the price.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have a pair of sony mdr-nc500d noise cancelling headphones that I thought were pretty good. But after I tried on a pair of these, the difference is astounding! The Bose headphones filter out way more background noise and sound is amazing! While they are more expensive than a lot of others, they are definitely worth the price."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Best noise canceling headphones I've seen.  With music going, ambient and other noises just fade away.  A must have for traveling, or just to really enjoy music."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel quite a bit, a few times around the world every year. The next best thing to business class is wearing a pair of these in economy. It makes a huge difference. Whether paired with my Zune, the onboard entertainment or just with them on with no cable attached while I am sleeping. I've had them a little over two years and I wouldn't hesitate to spend $300 to replace them. The bluetooth units are nice but you just can't beat the simplicity and universal availability of AAA batteries. And it lasts a long time on one AAA.Maybe Bose could come up with a bluetooth dongle that fits in the cord port on the head phones. It would be great to have a choice but probably too much battery drain.As far as the durability/cheapness issues go. It reminds me of reading the reviews for the Samsung S3 mobile phone, people complaining about the durability of the phone because it broke when they dropped it on a concrete floor. Umm, yeah, whatever. I got my Bose headphones while I was deployed in Afghanistan, used them every single day for over a year and they still looks the same as the first day I took it out of the package. I often fell asleep while wearing them. I am surprised the cord hasn't given out yet but when it does it's only $20 to replace it.Fits me well and I have no problem wearing them nonstop on a 12-14 hour flight.Do I wish they cost less than $300, sure. I also wished it didn't cost $90 for a second checked bag in economy too."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The sound quality coming from this headphone is exactly the same as bose ae2. The noise canceling is fantastic. You don't even have to listen to any music, once you turn it on, you will stop hearing most of noise.However, I really cannot wear this phone for more than half hour. I feel ear pressure immediately, like I'm taking a high speed elevator, my ears get sweating, and hot. The pressure sends a biological response to my stomach and thus feel a little sick. I love the sound and function. But obviously, this is not for me.The other downside about this earphone: it is tied to a AAA battery. It cannot function without using the battery."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have traveled with these several times now and they are wonderful.  I think they are the perfect addition to my iPad.  pop in a movie and I am outta here.  The sound is so rich and clear, and sometimes I sit right near the engines on the plane (hey, its steerage).  In my opinion, worth the price and Bose stands behind their product.  I did have a slight hum in one ear, so I called to find out if it was normal, it is not.  They asked me to send it back, they paid shipping, and they sent me brand new ones!!  Find a company like that nowadays = Bose."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Awesomesauce! These are very comfortable and really do work for steady noise. Please note that they will not cancel intermittent noise such as someone speaking! However, I got these for long airplane flights and they really work well. I was on a 9 hour flight recently and the engine/air noise was loud enought to be uncomfortable until I put on these headphones. Bliss! I even left them on and powered up without any music or videos just for the noise reduction. I did find a bit of &#34;ear fatigue&#34; after about 5-6 hours (since they work by actually directing sound against the outside sound). I took them off for about an hour to rest my ears, then back on they went. I have a couple of long trips coming up, and am recommending these to anybody who asks!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I avoided Bose earphones for years because of their high price, instead settling for Audio Tech. The Audio Techs finally gave me feedback troubles, so I bought a new pair, and they exhibited the same problem right out of the box. So I returned them and bought Bose instead. They have been fine. I think the noise canceling is a bit better as well (or perhaps it's the earphone fit), but the great advantage has been the lack of howling that afflicted the earlier earphones whenever I moved into certain positions. (I wear them at the gym to mask the awful music piped into that place, so this might not be as much of a problem for the road warrior trying only to silence the jet engines.) Anyhow, the Bose earphones were well worth the additional cost."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am very picky about sound, have a high end stereo at home. The sound of the QC15 is outstanding, you can easily separate sound components, the bases are deep enough to be real-like and rounded without sharp surroundings, not the tap-tap sound of cheap sound systems. I haven't tried it on a plane but at home it nicely muffled completely my noisy heating system, grand kids screaming in the house, the old fashion flashing toilet, oh well you get the idea. If in doubt, give it a try, the return policies are excellent.I didn't give a 5 star simply because I don't know what perfect is."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've had a couple pairs of Bose noise cancelling headphones and these are my favorites. The QC3s are more compact (and therefore have a slimmer case, which I like a lot), but they are &#34;on-ear&#34; instead of &#34;over-ear&#34;. The &#34;on-ear&#34; set-up gives me a headache if I use them for too long. Since I originally purchased these to help me study in the school library, that was a problem.The QC15s are over-ear, and I can wear them for a 5 hour stint with no issues. They block out most low level noise, but if there is a sharp noise, you will still hear it. Thus, these are fantastic for blocking the noise from an airplane engine humming, but not so great if you wanted to mute the sound of your kid's drum set. The case for the QC15s is pretty thick - almost inconveniently so. However, overall these are great headphones and I recommend them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My brother has recommended these for years and I finally decided to pick up a pair. All I can say is Wow! These are amazing noise cancellation headphones. They are extremely comfortable and the 'no wire' option is a huge plus.I have to admit, I haven't used these while flying yet. I have used them in my cube-land office setting and I have found that they help me concentrate and minimize distractions. (If you work in cube-land, you know what I'm talking about. My office environment isn't noisy, but it isn't quiet either. People taking on the phone, the annoying guy that has a radio in his cube turned up just enough that you can hear it but can't tell the song, impromptu meetings held in hallways, loud talkers, etc.)So what do you get for $300? The headphones, carrying case, battery, aircraft headphone adapter, two different wire options for listening to music - one with a combination in-line volume control/microphone for cell phones, one just for listening.I have to admit the $300 price tag was an issue for me. However, I am an audiophile and have loved Bose speaker systems since I purchased my first stereo system. The speakers on these headphones do not disappoint. For those who are new to Bose, they are a bit heavy on the bass. If you're looking for music headphones, I would suggest trying on and listening several different pairs - this is a totally subjective area. What I like and what you like may be totally different. However, if you are looking for a set of noise cancelling headphones, these are fantastic. The bonus is that you get a Bose sound system in addition to noise cancellation.For the record, I've used in-ear type earbuds for years that were billed as 'noise reducing' or 'sound isolating.' You know the type - they fit in your ear and physically block out the sound. The problem is that after a few hours, my ears would be sore. I certainly liked the small form factor (easy to lug around), but was always a bit disappointed by their performance with music and with noise cancellation. In addition, ear buds are notorious for breaking.In addition to the great sound (or lack thereof), they are very comfortable. I've worn them most of the day and I haven't had any complaints. I have a rather large melon and they fit me very well. From speaking to others who own a pair, they seem to fit almost any shaped head well. They are also comfortable in 'DJ' mode (when you have one cup off your ear to hear what is going on around you). These headphones have a solid feel, yet flexible. I've owned other over the ear headphones (Sennheiser, Denon) and these compare very well to them as far as build quality.Finally, the nicest surprise was the quality of the carrying case. These store flat (the ear cups rotate) and the case does not take up a lot of space. There is also room for any extras you may want to carry - it can comfortably carry the aircraft adapter & cords in the included mesh zipper bag. There is also room for an extra battery or two, a small USB charger, etc. You won't be able to pack a lot in the case, but it is sized well. The case makes it easy when packing - I carry a laptop and the case slides right in. Packing for a trip would be no different.The only con I can think is having to carry around an extra 'AA' battery or two, but this is minor compared to how well they work. The plus side is finding a battery won't ever be a problem - almost every airport gift-shop carries double A's.Overall a great set of noise cancelling headphones. Highly recommended."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Great headphones... I love the noise cancellation.  I am wearing them right now and can't even hear my typing!  Some people are complaining about the bass is to heavy for rap...  Isn't that a good thing? Also try on a pair of beats!  SO MUCH more bass with beats.  I like them.But a little pricey.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Seriously, Bose, the cord looks awfully flimsy for a $300 item. And it turns out, it actually IS that flimsy. With light use, and no cordwrapping of any kind, the thing started cutting out within six months. Now it's unusable, the internal wire apparently cracked or severed (looks fine on the outside). I'll look into my warranty options, but I Am Not Pleased. Won't by Bose again."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bought to replace the previous model. Frankly, Bose has done a great job of finding a jet's audio frequency and drowns it out very well but I was hoping the new model would do a better job with other noise like kisds and babies. Disappointing there."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,You just cannot beat them. A little pricey but well worth it. Great sound and or use for noise reduction.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"We could write a huge review full of our perspective and technical facts, however, everyone else who likes or dislikes Bose has done that already.  We purchased two pairs for our college aged kids and they love them.  I have a pair that I've used for years for business travel, and enjoy them every time I'm in the airport or tin can they call a plane.....especially with young kids or babies around me!!!Amazon has the best price, quality, delivery, so what else can you ask for right?  Lot's of choices out there, so if you have the time or you're into the latest style these might not be for you....however, stay with the proven leader.....go with Bose!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"While noise cancellation and comfort are great, the sound is not really all that &#34;wow&#34; and and it feels very cheaply made. Not to mention the cord, very skinny with no strain relief at the jack (kind of like a skullcandy jack). Therefore it was returned."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Picked up a pair on a whim before a 40 hour total flying-time round-trip from the US to India.  Was skeptical at the price but knew Bose has a reputation for quality.  I have flown over 400,000 miles in my lifetime and can't believe I never thought of buying some NC headphones.  They come well packaged in a nice carrying case that will protect from all but the most extreme conditions.  One word describes these: AMAZING!They reduced cabin noise over 90% even when not listening to music.Made the inflight entertainment system tolerable and I could actually hear the dialog without loosing my hearingLong battery life.  Single AAA battery lasted entire tripComfortable enough to wear for hours on endHave volume and mute control for Apple devices when using the additionally included cordNot much more to say but I am totally impressed with these and am glad that I picked them up."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These work really well.  I don't understand the technology, but they are actually noise canceling The first time I used them was on a commercial flight.  We know how noisey they can be.  They out performed the noise canceling Bose earbuds.  Worth every penny!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"A few years ago flying on a cross country trip I was fortunate enough to be bumped to first class.  I sat next to a rich dude who subtly bragged about his material possessions and owned property during take off and landing.  One of the items he bragged about was his new Bose headphones, and he insisted I listen to them.  Sure enough, they were outstanding, but I didn't travel often enough to justify the price tag.Well fast forward a few years and I now have a job that requires me to fly a few times a month.  So I took the plunge and used my hotel loyalty points to get me a free set of these Bose headphones.They impressed me out of the box as much as the very first time I listened to them (or the equivalent I had tried a few years back).  The noise just melts away into the background so that it is hardly noticeable at all.  I took my first flight with them today and tried them in a very busy crowded airport terminal.  My music sounded wonderful, and the cacophony of random people and machine noise all but vanished.  And that was quite a challenging test, the noise levels were pretty high in a fairly confined round terminal hub.  The music source was simply my phone, a Samsung Infuse, not a dedicated music player.Next I wore them on a plane for a short 80 minute jet flight.  It's like being in a different world.  The music from my android phone sounded awesome, the noise practically vanished.  Somehow without the constant racket of the plane the time seemed to just go by quicker too.The headphones were extremely comfortable, and the excessively hot day didn't add any problems either.To me Bose are a company I have a lot of respect for.  They always seem to innovate and amaze.  As an audiologist I am well versed in acoustics and the physics of sound, and to create this level of noise reduction so seamlessly is very impressive, especially if their claims of battery life are close to accurate.The headphones fit in a very attractive slim case.  There is even a little space in there for a couple of spare batteries if you wanted.  This model ships with a standard headphone cord and also an iPod/iPad/iPhone version which has a microphone on the wire.  I question how useful that would be simply because when you wear these headphones it is hard to tell how loud your own voice is to some extent, so I'd be worried about shouting to the person on the other end of the phone, and also if it is noisy enough to wear them, I wonder how well the person being called would hear anyway.  In any case, I replaced my iPhone with an Android based phone recently so I've not tested that feature.The bottom line is these are expensive headphones.  Truth be told if you go to Best Buy and listen to some other headphones at half the price, you'd probably get better or similar sound quality.  What you won't get though is the incredible noise reduction system that Bose has been working on for many years.  That combination of a great sound AND the noise reduction is what makes this product work.  If your life involves plenty of air travel, or other similar travel that includes background noise, then these will really improve that journey for you.  Music sounds great, audio books are far easier to hear, even Angry Birds is more enjoyable without all that background noise.  In fact when you put these on in almost any environment, it makes you realize how much ambient noise there is in so many places.I think the only real issue is if your budget and lifestyle justifies the price tag.***Update: Since writing this I have also tried watching a DVD on my laptop in my hotel room.  Again these headphones eat through noise like the air conditioning, ventilation in the bathroom, noises from other guests, the whir of the DVD drive, the refrigerator etc.  The sound quality off my laptop was just exceptional too, rich bass, clear treble, good mid tones.  I can already see myself using these for more than just plane rides."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I use noise cancelling on planes and during travel at various hotels. The Sony and Audiotechnica have a white noise buzz which does not work for getting to sleep, but the Bose were quiet and when used with foamy ear plugs got a great night of rest.  Zzzzzz for Bose for both the plane and hotel room."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I debated for awhile about the Beats Studio by Dr. Dre and the Bose.  The one thing that put me over the edge is the noise cancelling quality and the remote iPhone/iPod control for volume and functions.  I'm very glad I did, as I couldn't be happier with the Bose purchase.  As for quality for a $300 headphone, it's hard to tell right now, as it is plastic, but the sounds quality is superb!High recommended!!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"We had two pair of the earlier generation of these. Each pair developed a problem after 3-4 years of use. A little fiddling, a quick bit of soldering and we combined them to get one working pair from the old ones.  My 11 year old son just used the old pair on a cross country flight and we got two new pair for ourselves.The new ones appear to have slightly more room in the ear cup and worked great our flights."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have to admit I have only just received this pair of headphones, but I have been wearing them regularly for the whole day. This review will be updated accordingly as I discover new flaws or new methods to overcome existing ones.First of all, the noise cancellation is top-notch. I have tried out a pair of Beats Studio in BestBuy and I don't really like it, plus I think the design is a bit too bold and ""in your face"" for me. As others have pointed out, the Studio's noise cancellation isn't exactly good, so when I ordered this pair of Bose online (I didn't have the chance to try them on in BestBuy because there were a lot of people on Black Friday) and got them, I was pleasantly surprised with the NC, I can't even hear my own heartbeat!I am not an audiophile but streaming music 320kbps on Spotify premium sounds really crisp and sharp, with the small details popping out like the sound of a harp, perhaps.At the time of writing, the one extremely major flaw is that the headphone bleeds sound. When listening to music on my iPhone with the volume anywhere above level 3 (three small white boxes), which is extremely soft, my girlfriend who is sitting beside me can hear what I am listening to. I bought this pair of headphones expecting to use it in the library when some people there think it's funny to talk about games and girls while people are studying for midterms, but now it seems that this is no longer possible if the headphones continue to bleed. If anyone manages to overcome this issue please leave a comment and let me know.Next, I don't know why but the headphones tend to slide off my head when I'm lying on an incline 45 degree chair, and the side of my ears get a bit itchy after wearing it, so I might be doing something wrong here because people are saying how comfortable this pair of headphones are.In short:Like:- sound quality- noise cancellation capabilityDislike:- bleeds sound (MAJOR FLAW)- slightly uncomfortable for meUPDATE #1:After talking to a Bose Facebook operator, I checked my fit and indeed I was wearing it with the top band a bit lower than it should be (right on top of your head). After adjusting the fit, the sound doesn't bleed as much now but it still does (at around 40% iPhone volume now as compared to 20-30%). One thing to note is that I kept my inline control at LOW, meaning the volume isn't as loud, so 40% iPhone volume at LOW is quite soft for me. I will try this product for a few more days and update accordingly."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Like many other users, I have experienced the same ""pressure"" when using them without input of any kind. With music on, this feeling is almost imperceptible. With time, I've noticed it even less, so I concluded it must be a perceived and not actual pressure. Once you get over it, you'll enjoy these headphones for what they were meant to do: quiet time. Great fit and comfort, good sound reproduction, very light and portable. A bit on the plasticky side so I hope they last.  Yes they are expensive but I haven't found anything this effective to compare against."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I looked at an number of other options for NC headphones and ended up going with the Bose.  The noise cancelling is incredible and they are very comfortable.  I don't know a person that owns these and is disappointed in the performance.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I use the Bose headset to kill the noise on long airline flights.  It does an unbelievably good job of producing the recorded sound and blocking the extraneous noise.  Worked so well I tried it in the dentist's office but found the noise there is generated internally and can't be blocked.  The set is comfortable for wearing hours' on end and seldom requires battery replacement.  Expensive, but worth the price if you have a need for noise cancellation."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have tried the $80 Panasonic noise cancelling head phones, and this Bose QC15 set.  The Bose are the clear winner in terms of ""cancelling"" ambient noise.  Don't get me wrong, these or any set of noise cancelling headphones won't cancel all ambient noise, but for trips from the USA to Europe in economy class (meaning the back of the jet) they are a great help.  I would not dream of traveling without them.  As to music reproduction, well, my fifty-something ears are happy to have some relief from the jet noise and to be able to hear my music or ipad movie soundtrack.  I also use these headphones for long auto trips, wherein the wife likes to sleep and I can listen to my iphone/ipod downloads.  Much more comfortable than ear buds and, again, the ambient noise is managed very nicely.As to comfort on the head, they are fine.As to build quality, they seem fine.  Lots of plastic but nothing has broken so far.  The single AAA battery goes for a very long time.  I do not like the semi-proprietary cable that Bose supplies for the connection of the headphones to the output device.  A plain 3.5mm stereo plug will work but one has to work at it due to the Bose weirdly designed inset socket in the headphones. Bose could have made this a non-issue, but they didn't. I mention this because I have a cat that likes to chew cables, and at some point I will need to replace the supplied cable.I am grateful that Bose and others have come up with a way for traveling or working in a noisy environment to be more comfortable.  Well done Bose.  Mostly."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Some of my friends have already bought these headphones for themselves after I raved about them. I fly almost weekly and grew weary of crying babies and sinus-snorting neighbors. These fit comfortably and block most of the noise. They fold neatly into the carrying case which has enough room for my Ipod and reading glasses.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Bose QuietComfort 15I have resisted buying Bose for a long time. I have tons of other headphones that are uncomfortable and urt my head and ears. I have a drawer full of headphones with shorts in the fixed wired cable and ones that simply sound bad. I have at least one other noise canceling set that literally do not cancel out any noise. If I add up what I spent for all those bad headphones, I could have had these a long time ago (maybe two). I am not an audiophile, but I enjoy my music. I have over 2,000 songs on my iPad, but I listen to more music on Pandora.I do my most listening to audio on my iPhone with the Stitcher Radio app. Podcasts satisfy my listening pleasures as well offer a convenient way to stay informed of my interests.  I also enjoy watching movies and TV episodes on my mobile devices. The Bose QuietComfort 15 is wonderful addition to my world. They sound beautiful and so comfortable I hardy know I am wearing them. I am tender headed and most headphone hurt the top of my head (especially more that it covered less with hair these days).My family is decorating the Christmas tree as I type this and I can't hear any of the constant chatter except barely between songs. It is funny to see their lips moving, but I hear no sound  With a wife and two preteens girls, I finally have a escape that doesn't remove me from the room. I love these and can't wait to use them on my daily commute on the bus next week to and from work.Pros: Comfort, Noise canceling is fantastic, case quality and shape, soundCons: Pricey, Battery is required to function at all"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I purchased these to replace a pair that I had owned for 8 years, which the wife broke trying to put them in the case bending the cups the wrong way.  I called Bose to see if I could replace the broken yoke, but unfortunately, it was not a repairable item.  Bose, however, offered to replace the broken set with a new, latest model for 1/3 the retail price.  I jumped at the chance and then bought this set for my wife so she could have her own set to break.  Working with Bose service was very easy:  answered call immediately with no wait;  service rep. spoke clear english (bit of boston accent...lol); and the RMA and replacement process was very convenient and fast.In terms of how this product works, well I travel to Asia several times a year and would not leave on a plane trip without these.  It filters out nearly all the Plane engine noise and with a little soft music it pretty much filters out all background noise.  Battery life is excellent.  I am not a audio geek so I really can't speak to the sound quality, other than it sounds great to me.Yes, you pay a little extra for Bose, but you also get what you paid for.  Note, this product is made in Mexico."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These will forever change the way you fly. Engine noise, crying babies, annoying talkative (but friendly) passengers, etc. all gone. It's like you're in your own world. When you take them off after a 2 hour flight, you realize immediately how great these headphones are.A few things to note:-Carry extra batteries with you. The headphones will not work without batteries. You have to turn them on for any sound to come out. Battery life is excellent. You'll be able to use the same batteries for multiple flights, but you just don't want to be stuck without.-It can be difficult to sleep with these on. It's not very comfy to put your head against something, and if you do, you could get unwanted noise and vibrations. With just the right positioning, it is possible though, or if you can sleep without your head having to be to the side.-Noise cancellation essentially recognizes the repeating pattern of a sound. So something like jet noise is easy to cancel out because it's the same sound over and over. Sounds like talking are not easily cancelled. However, those types of sounds are greatly reduced from the noise isolation of the over-the-ear  style headphones, and the sound of your own music usually drowns those other noises out.-The volume does not need to be up all the way. I don't like blaring my headphones, so I usually have the volume at about half on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3). And that's plenty to get the full appreciation of the headphones.-The sound quality is good. Decent highs and mid-range tones. If you prefer heavy bass, it may not have enough, but the main reason you should be buying these headphones is for the noise cancellation."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've put Bose noise cancelling headphones on in the store a few times and was never that impressed at how they didn't cancel out background voices that well.  Which is what I want when I'm flying.  I don't know if the design got better or my use change.  In any case, I've been using them while mowing the yard and I'm very happy with them.  Yes, that is a terrible way to use a very expensive set of headphones.  But having good sounding tunes makes mowing much more enjoyable for me.  Paired with an iPod, mowing has become a relaxing time for me.  In the past, I used sound isolating in-ear buds covered by over-the-ear hearing protection muffs.  The ear buds I had (Denon) were very good, but they died and I had not been able to find a good substitute that adequately isolated noise from my ears while still sounding good.  The Bose headphones sound good, are lightweight and comfortable, and so far I haven't replaced the batteries this season.  I've experienced no ringing in my ears.  I do make sure I limit how loud I'm playing the music.  I am curious to see how well they work the next time I fly somewhere."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have just about every genre covered on my ipod touch. My primary genre is Classical, but I explore different genres as well. Hip-hop (in different languages) R&B ( in different languages), pop, rock, foreign music.. etc. So, anyhow, I was able to test the headphones with my device at my local target store. There was NO difference from my current BOSE headphones and that is even with the noise cancellation feature.. I could get the headphones for a fraction of a price through a friend, but it is not even worth 300.00..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Go ahead, spend the extra money and get the best...BOSE!  As a bona fide music snob, I can recommend these for the beautiful clarity of sound.  I also find the noise cancelling more than sufficient.  As we all know, there will probably never be headphones that completely cancel out sound, but this is about the best you can get!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Literally the best electronics purchase I have ever made. Super expensive and super worth it. Knowing what I know now after experiencing them on a daily basis I would pay double. Battery life is excellent. Throw these on at work while going into the zone and everything I mean everything fades away. You can hear a thing but what you intend to hear which is the music. They also help for crying babies at night when you can unplug and just turn on the noise canceling feature. Now the noise canceling alone isn't going to stop gunshots, be realistic. They help with ambient aggravating sounds. I always use a fan and night and sometimes reading a book in bed can get irritating. Put these on next to the fan and the fan noise literally goes away! Super awesome. People at work love them. Love the quick detachable audio cable. Can't tell you how many times I've caught the cable on something, rolled over it in my chain or one of my kids yanks it out. Headphones never leave your head and they don't get damaged. I always thought of bose as over rated. I stand corrected. We tested these at work with someone else's beats by dre. Same song same audio level. You couldn't tell mine were on standing around me. You could sing along to his. They do not leak noise."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I needed a pair of very high quality noise canceling headphones that I could use alone - in a situation where I can't connect my iPod. After doing some research, most everyone suggests that Bose are the best. In addition, I know several people who also own these and recommended them when I told them what I was looking for. Without hesitation, each strongly suggested that I get the Bose, even though they are extremely expensive. After some thought, I took the plunge and bought them - I just received them today. Needless to say, I'm absolutely amazed - I wore them in several public places and all noise (with the exception of voices and a siren) completely disappeared. While sitting in an office, the music being piped in to the waiting room disappeared. I'm sitting at home now, wearing them, and all sounds are gone - including the noise my computer makes and the air conditioning. I'm THRILLED!Update: After I wrote this review, I received another expensive noise cancelling headset,SOUL by Ludacris SL300WB High Definition Noise Canceling Headphones (Black/White). I have now spent a lot of time with both and think that Bose is superior. I wrote a rather extensive review on the Soul if you want to see how they compare."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've had to use these headphones a lot lately to watch movies without disturbing my family.  They're very comfortable for two hour movies and the battery lasts a long time compared to a cheap JVC noise-cancelling set that I used to have.  I never thought I would pay $300 for headphones, but these are definitely worth it.  The noise-cancelling works well so you protect your hearing because you don't have to turn on the volume that high to hear what's going on.  I love these so much that I recommended them to a coworker and he also purchased them and loved them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I was shocked at how pleasant a flight could be with these headphones.  I didn't really think they were providing that much value until I took them off a few times to see what the noise really was.  They are  much more effective with an audio input running (mp3 off my phone) than without but my wife asked how my flight was and I told her it was the most pleasant flight I've ever been on (she doesn't yet know I spent $300 on a pair of headphones).  I later thought about that comment...  it really was the best flight I've ever been on because I was totally relaxed and actually enjoyed my music and reading.  VERY glad I got these so far.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I was initially blown away by these headphones when trying them out in an Apple store.  Amazing sound from an iPod and the QC15s almost entirely blocked out the din of noise in the store.  Bought a pair and after several days use...they're going back.Bottom line:The QC15s are plastic and have a cheap appearance.  They are doing remarkable things with plastic these days, so plastic does not equate to flimsy or breakable.  It's the appearance.Sound quality is really good.  But for the price, would be nice to have great.Noise cancellation is superb.  This is the strong suit.  Frequent flyers love them for that.  I,however, do not fly frequently.  I need noise cancellation for the neighbors' leaf blowers and baying hounds.  Think I will go with ""the poor man's"" (or, since I'm in Tennessee, the redneck's) noise cancellation headphones--ear buds and shooter's ear muffs.These are pricey...unless you are a frequent flyer who needs this level of noise cancellation, I would look at other options."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I do feel that these are overpriced, but the noise cancellation is excellent and helps me to better listen to music or the audio track of a movie I'm watching while I'm sitting on an airplane without having to strain my ears.  The headband and earphones sit very comfortably over my head covering both of my ears. I'm not an audiophile, but I find that the audio it plays does sound fairly clear to me.  The aesthetic design appears sleek although the build quality does not feel particularly sturdy. It does come with a nice travel case and the audio cable is conveniently disconnectable.  The headphones only needs 1 AAA battery to turn the noise cancellation on, but if you don't have a working battery in there than it ceases to adequately function as a set of headphones (technically it does still play audio into the earphones, but at a severely reduced volume that is difficult to hear anything), which is my main knock on these headphones, along with the inflated price.Overall, the comfort and the high quality of the noise cancellation ability move me toward recommending these headphones if you travel frequently on mass-transportation vehicles (airplanes, buses, trains, subways, etc.), and can afford the high pricing."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Finally got the opportunity today to test these in flight.  I was sitting right on the front end of the wing, next to the engines.  These phones are incredible and I'm very sorry I didn't shell out the $$$ and buy them years ago.  They make the arduous task of flying a real pleasure."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I was going to return these because they are just so insanely expensive. I've been putting them on to the test around my house (which is hell loud) from the traffic outside. Trucks and cars bang and slam into pot holes while they go by all day and night, it's constant. I bought these with little hope of alleviating the problem. My jaw was literally on the floor when I put these on and stood at the window watching the cars slam by and heard nothing! I wore them outside and you can still hear the traffic but at a much lower decibel level. I wanted to hate these so I could get my money back and yes, they wreak like cigarettes (must be the packing material) but the noise cancellation is beyond my dreams. I have left the music on the lowest sound and been able to relax. My mind and body! I'm not all tense and wound up since I can't hear the traffic. It's a whole different world with these on. While I'm going to struggle paying them off, I definitely feel like these are a necessity if you live in a loud house or apartment. They drown out street noise and bassy-type noises. I love them! UPDATE- after a few days of using them, they pick up sounds I didn't even know were there watching tv; I keep taking them off to see if it's an ""outside"" noise. These headphones are outstanding! Plus they have already paid for themselves in noise related anxiety reduction alone. I wish I hadn't waited so long to get these."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"i can say that i sent them back because i was looking for more bass for $300 dollars, so these might be for someone but not me.  but if you  do want bass, look at the Skullcandy Crushers."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Please be aware that you can't listen even *without* the noise cancelling if your battery dies.The battery that came with them (I know, I should have used a fresh one) died twenty minutes into a three hour flight.Not cool.Also, it's such a *small* battery.Would be so much better if they looked into solar powering these things...Wish I had returned these even though they work great *with* the battery because I have enough to remember in my everyday life without having to worry about a battery for my headphones, but alas, I missed my window."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It has been a personal dream of mine since I was a young lad to get a pair of these at some point in my life, and this past Christmas that dream came to fruition. I couldn't help but think, ""Is this real? This is!"" As I unboxed the package and looked at all the glorious contents -- the sleek case, the soft around-ear cushions, the Bose logo in silver -- I couldn't help but get a slight feeling of skepticism. Now that I had what I've wanted for years, now that it is in my hands, will the product perform to my built expectations??Romantic and slightly-exaggerated verbiage aside, I can tell you after using the headphones consistently for weeks in a variety of settings they indeed perform. It's amazing how much easier it is to read on a plane with a pair of these on. Even when in my quiet room at night beside my lovely wife, playing music softly as I wind down for slumber is on a different level now. The noise-cancellation works impeccably.I think what surprises me the most is the crispness in sound. With a lot of composers and DJs I've listened to on these, I heard subtleties and intricacies in songs I had never picked up on, even on songs I've listened to an absurd amount of times. Bands sound so crisp it's similar to being at a live show. If you're into dubstep, don't expect to be blasted with bass -- instead be prepared to hear bass at such a sharp and rich level you'll be able to feel the modulations in frequency (Production will show, too; you'll quickly figure out which DJs are new to the scene). Unless you are used to Bose headphones or a related brand/price level, your music experience will be much different after putting these on your ears.In my job I travel 1-2x a month, so these work extremely well in that situation. However, I love using them at home during the week, too. I've even been tempted to bring them into the office for those down times of each day.I've seen some reviewers talk about how the make is cheap compared to competitors. I've been a Bose enthusiast for years, and if there's one thing I know it's that they don't make their stuff cheaply. I own several Bose products, and I can tell you each of them still sounds new after 5+ years. Even if a Bose product does take a wrong turn, if you take it to them directly they'll stand by their product and make sure you're treated right. But in terms of breaking easily or being made cheaply, I would hope no one would treat a $300 pair of headphones carelessly.These headphones are an investment just like any other high-end product. But if you love listening to music, have an occupation where you regularly travel, or you haven't had the chance to truly experience a Bose product, this investment is worth your time. If you are seriously considering these, I'd recommend going to Best Buy or a Bose store at the mall to test them out as there are a couple different models of their headphones."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Even a little surreal, the first time you activate them.  These things are like an upgrade from coach to business, at least in the sound and stress departments.  By that standard they are a bargain.The sound is good, too.  Better, in my opinion, than my other set of headphones which, with their dedicated external amplifier, cost close to three times what these did.  Those will be up for sale.They do not work at all without activating the noise cancellation.  The sound is there, but faint.  This makes me suspect that these use the battery to amplify the sound signal as well as to drive the noise cancellation feature.  Add decent little speakers and you end up in a category of headphone performance that is unusual at this price.They blow away many headphones at this price point by  using the same principles that audiophile systems use:  good headphones (probably equivalent to 70 to 100 dollar models) with a dedicated, battery powered signal amplifier (300+ by itself, generally).  Then they go a step further and blot out all the outside noise (non-existent in the audiophile world).  The cherry on top of the icing is that it's all built into the headphones.  No mare carrying around a bag of wires and boxes for good headphone sound.  The resulting silence allows inner details to come through and convincing dynamics.There are many better sounding headphones out there, though for this price it will be hard to find some.  Those will also need help from headphone amplifiers and require a quiet environment.  They will not work well in, for example, an airplane.  They will not sound good with an iPod without an outboard amp.These do create a sense of pressure inside the ear cups.  This can get old after about an hour.  You'll want to take them off to let your ears breath.  That said, most headphones create some degree of ear fatigue, anyway.These headphones contradict many stereotypes about Bose being overpriced, sub-audiophile items.  The price is reasonable for what they deliver and they sound very good!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I tried on several of these headphones in the stores. They were the most comfortable I had ever worn.  Sound is great and noise cancelling is excellent but after wearing for 20-30 minutes they start to hurt my ears.  I do have big ears and they stick out from my head so I guess it is partially my fault.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Sound quality is better, and I like the fact that the ever so easy earphone cushions of the original can be replaced with new ones without having to repurchase the new Q15 if your budget can't handle it or you simply are still happy with your original Q15s. The originals the cushioning while comfortable was not durable. A sneaky way for an up sell. I am glad to know that if the ear pieces need replaced, I can do so for about $40 plus s&h. I have the new Q 3s as well. They are comfortable, but feel the new and even the original Q15's have better sound quality and the noise cancelation while does its job, the design of the ear piece can easily make it less noise canceling. Choosing between the models I would definitely recommend the new Q15 over the Q3."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"After trying on about fifty different headphones, I finally bought these at the Bose store in Leesburg, VA.  After using them for a week, I am extremely happy with them.  The sound quality is awesome.  In fact, I listen to more music than I ever did before.  The noise cancellation is excellent, but that's not the reason I bought these.  These are the most comfortable headphones I could find anywhere.  All the other full size headphones are much heavier and feel tight on my head after an hour.  Last night, I wore these for two hours straight without a problem.Initially, the noise cancellation bothered my.  I felt pressure on my ears.  But they sound so good, I didn't want to return them.  I have gotten used to them now.  The bass comes out loud and clear.  The mids and highs are clear and crisp.  I have tried these with my smartphone, computer and even the roku 3 remote.  All music sounds excellent.  These sound much better than the Sony MDR-V55 headphones I got for about $80.These are expensive.  I got mine for $240.  But, they are worth the money.  Especially since Bose really supports their products and will not give you any grief if anything goes wrong."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is a great ANC headset.  Its very light and truly performs and totally dampens the noise in the A/C cabin where I used it.  Did not try at home, however, in aircraft, you will hardly even notice that the engine is on and the aircraft is flying.  Would not recommend it for pilots as you would not notice if your engine is running or not!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Look, this thing is amazing if you're a frequent flyer. I haven't tried other models but after using this on a few flights I wouldn't bother with any other model. But when using this outside a plane, it's not worth the price. Keeping in mind that this is battery powered so it won't work at all without batteries. Second, the sound quality is good, but I didn't appreciate it that much. I'm not a Beats by Dre fan (meaning I don't need all the bass) but this thing just isn't loud enough when you're not using it inside an airplane. It's like the magic only happens when you pit it against an airplanes engines."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I own less expensive noise-reduciing headphones. These are the real deal. Their test run was travel involving around 15 hrs combined flight time (10-12 hrs for the trans-Atlanitc legs) each way. I used ear plugs to sleep, but otherwise had these on all the way.Pros: comfortable, don't feel any weight. Nice case, holds my ipod nano and plug adspters easily. Good build quality. Good battery life. Excellent noise cancellation. Excellnt sound quality.Cons: pricey (as with anything Bose), cannot use them with power offOverall, I love them. Money well spent if you travel, or want to tune out the world from time to time."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,Bought it as a gift and is going strong for more than an year. Very good noise cancellation and great sound. Very good for traveling and comfortable for long use.
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've tried a lot of ANR (active noise reduction) and normal headphones.  By far the best has been the ANR's and Bose.  Bose may not have invented ANR, but they seriously have taken in to the next level.  I have taken my QC-15's around the world several times, in everything from planes (suggested) to helicopters (not suggested) and I absolutely must say they are the best.  I do have to say that if you get these, and need to fly in a helicopter, do not use them (you will blow out a speaker or two).The ANR works wonderfully, but even better, the range of sound from the head phones is absolutely amazing.  I love my QC-15's, and when I burn these out (I use them 23 hours a day), I will gladly spend the money to get new ones.  My greatest suggestion that I can give, is keep your receipt, BOSE has a great return policy, but not if you don't have your receipt.  Seriously, if you like music and your ears, BUY THESE."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Received the Beats executive headphones as a gift, and I could not stand them, as they were quite heavy, and ear crushing, and it made you want to take them off after 15 minutes.  They were that bad!  Oh yeah, they were great for bass sound overkill creating a hip/hop Phil Spector bass wall of sound, but fidelity wise, the clarity to hear those many crucial instruments, was not there.  I took them back to the store, and exchanged them for the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 noise cancelling model, and what a difference.  The comfort of the Bose was immediately noticeable, as I can wear these for hours if needed, without that heavy ear crushing feeling.  The noise cancellation on the Bose was also noted to be superior.  Yes the beats construction is obviously more solid, with more metal, and extra weight, but that is precisely why they are not very comfortable.  The ear cups of the Bose is soft leather, and it contours around your ear much better than the hardened lining of the Beats.  Also, on the beats, there is a hiss that is annoying when the noise cancellation is activated.  They both will not work when the Noise cancellation is not activated.  Overall, for superior comfort, and better noise cancellation, as well as a higher quality of fidelity, the Bose is my choice.  If it is a louder thumping bass sound you crave, and more solid metal parts, then maybe the Beats are for you.  I tried them both, and  the Bose QC15's, make for a better overall listening experience."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I've been looking for noise canceling headphones for a while now and after much research and hemming and hawing, I purchased these from the Apple Store in Grand Central Station in New York. After less than a week of owning them, I returned them. My overall thoughts:* Noise cancellation - 10/10 - First, people have to understand what you can expect from noise canceling headphones and what you can't. ""Noise canceling"" is probably a misnomer. The whole industry should probably call them ""White Noise Canceling"" headphones. Noise canceling headphones will NOT get rid of all noise. It gets rid of the hums, buzzes, vibrations...the noise that you forget is there but is there. These headphones do a great job of getting rid of those sounds. It also does an adequate job of limiting voices around you, but that's probably just due to the fact that these are over the ear phones and not because of the noise canceling. If you want headphones that will simply reduce the overall decible level, you're probably going to want to look into what Etymotic has or Direct Sound EX29, which as the name implies supposedly can drop the decibel level by 29.* Durability/Quality - Don't know, but I would bet against it. - Sorry, I walked into a Best Buy and their display model had the leather of one of the ears completely off. That simply didn't sit well with me. And their warranty is only for a year and you have to pay for shipping both ways. Sorry, if you pay $300 for a set of phones, the LEAST they can do is warranty the thing for two years and pay for shipping if there are any problems. I mean, after all, the assumption is that if you're charging your customer $300 they're getting a superior product in every way and they shouldn't have to worry about poor quality, right? If you're going to give me the same warranty that I can get for a pair of $25 phones, then what am I paying for?Let's put it like this. My friend has a pair of AudioTechnica's and I don't feel the Bose give you anything more in terms of quality.* Sound - I thought the sound quality overall was good but it wasn't like I was blown away. I felt that nothing was accentuated. If you're looking for super base, these are not the headphones for you. The good thing is that you can set the volume at 50% or lower and hear everything great because of the noise canceling. But the sound quality itself didn't make me feel that I got my money's worth.* Sound leakage - At 50% volume, you *can* hear sound coming out of the headphones, but nothing that would disturb anyone in a quiet room. It's nothing to worry yourself about. If you have the volume at 100%, well you have bigger issues, like your ears being assaulted!* Comfort - 0/10 and ultimately why I returned them - YMMV and you may want to take my opinion with a grain of salt here, but no matter how I adjusted these things, I felt uncomfortable downward pressure on the top of my head. Let's put it like this. I returned them around 7:15pm EST today and right now my laptop says it's 11:15. Four hours later AND I STILL FEEL PRESSURE ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD! When I mentioned this to my brother-in-law, who also has a pair, he said, ""Oh, you have to tilt them forward a little more."" So he obviously has noticed it as well. Bottom line, however, there's simply no position I could find that made wearing these headphones comfortable. By the way, although the padding seems buttery soft, once the padding is compressed you can feel the hardness of the headband QUICKLY! The hardness of the headband was what I was feeling, no matter how much I tried to loosen them. I actually don't get that, because I wouldn't expect that."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are great!  They have excellent sound no matter what I plug them into.  Noise cancelling is nice to as I can put them on to read or study and drown out the TV or appliances running.  My only complaint would be that since I wear them so much they sometimes get uncomfortable but I think it's the combination of the ear cups and my glasses.  If I am just listening to music and have my glasses off it doesn't bother me so much.It's also nice that these come with two cords, one Apple product rigged with a volume control and mute right on the cord and one not.  I do seem to go through a fair amount of batteries so I keep some spares in the very nice case.If you use headphones a lot and appreciate the quality of Bose sound these headphones are a wonderful product.I selected these when picking between these and Dr. Dre beats...a tough decision as both have fabulous sound."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"People who are saying that these block ambient noise well, have significant hearing loss.I am far from a youngster, and have my share of hearing loss... (...worked in military and civilian aviation, shot more than my share of guns, etc.) Right now, I am at a well-known fast food restaurant (the clown's place), with this headset on, with a brand new battery.I can hear slightly muffled nasty background music. The news is  blaring from the flat screen on the. It's at about 1/4 full volume, and I can hear it, even though I can't make out all the words. The kids in the next booth, behind a partition - I hear them, as well as a guy few tables away talking to a kid who works here.QuietComfort? Hardly! Maybe if you wear them in solitary confinement!Pros: The pads and the head band are comfortable.The sound is great.The case is nice, but overkill.Cons: Battery doesn't last long. I use Duracell ProCells.No auto-off. Is it really that hard to make the thing sense that there is no audio, and auto power off after 15 min or so?!  300$ and the Bose sticker ain't enough to warrant that simple feature, which every 50$ cell phone has?!If you think this is going to cancel out jet engine noise on flights, as some here say, you better get some hearing loss to go with this headset! It can't even block out elevator music and conversation in a half-empty restaurant!So tired of paying so much for so little besides fluff, advertising and brand..."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I notice the noise canceling the most when I'm on an airplane. It's not as good for blocking out people talking, babies screaming, etc., but for steady noises (like plane engines), it's fantastic."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I received these as an office party favor. For free, I like them. I don't think I'd spend the money on them for myself.Positives:Noise cancellation is freakishly good with white and pink noise. These silence my dishwasher. They quiet, but do not silence, my clicky keyboard and my Mac's mail received noise.Bose did a good job by including two types of audio cable (regular and with iPhone style controls) and a nice carrying case. The headphones can be used for sound isolation without having an audio cable plugged in. One of my friends pointed out immediately that this would be a useful feature for anybody with a sensory deprivation fetish. Not sure about that one myself, but it's probably a valid point in the positive column if you like that sort of thing.Neutral:Sound quality isn't on the level of other headphones in this price class. It's good, better than most of the headphones people use, but not amazing.I never bought into the noise canceling headphone concept before because they always felt odd to my ears. Not the physical shape of the things, but it's sort of a feeling of pressure caused by a residual very soft, very high pitched audio. This is partly due to my sensitivity in that range. If you are also somebody who, when TVs were CRTs, could tell that one was turned on in another room of the same house because the tube emits a high pitched background noise you can hear, you will probably notice this effect. These headphones exhibit that effect, but a lot less so than other models I've tried.Negative:Build quality feels too cheap for the pricing. The plastic, the battery cover that feels flimsy and needs to be pushed to lock in. Not impressed.They can't be used as regular, non-noise-canceling headphones. If you turn off the noise canceling switch you lose audio as well, except for a very faint sound. These must rely on an internal powered amp."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Pros:- Amazing noise canceling, best i have tested so far- great ergonomics- works and is comfortable over glasses (i'm wearing glasses and it was important for the headphones not only to isolate noise, but to be comfortable as well)- great a headset functionality working with Mac and iPhoneCons (only one i've found so far):- don't when noise canceling is off"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These things are awesome!  I fly often enough that I wanted a nice pair of noise cancelling headphones.  These work very well, and these were a refurbished pair.  They came in and looked as if they were 100% new.  I have had them for about a year now with no issues or complaints.  It came with a nice hardshell case to prevent damage when tossing them into a bag or briefcase.  The battery life is excellent and I think I've only changed them 2x in the past year with considerable use!As a note - always keep a spare battery (AAA) on hand - if the battery dies you won't be able to use them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Paying 300 bucks for headphones isn't for the faint of heart or the average budget, but some things are just ""necessary"". First of all, I travel frequently (two or three times a month, at least), and noise cancelling headphones are ESSENTIAL for air travel. People don't seem to be as thoughtful as they used to be -- there's often someone blabbering loudly and incessantly on flights, as if they're oblivious to everyone else onboard. Or the person sitting next to me that thinks it's socially acceptable to spend an hour telling me their life story. Now...I'm no grouch, but there are limits.  Secondly, these Bose headphones have proven invaluable in my work, which often involves a lot of intense data analysis (I'm a computer security consultant).  With these headphones, I can disappear into a world of pleasant sound (I highly recommend Liquid Mind for studying or intense work!), and work far more efficiently and with a lot less stress.So...bravo! for the headphones, and a knockdown to four stars for the somewhat flimsy feel to them and the price. For $300 I'd expect something far sturdier, and the thin cord worries me a little.  No doubt Bose is making money hand over fist with these things, but hopefully it's not at the expense of quality.  Time will tell."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I had a Sharper Image noise cancelling headphones but felt like it was still allowing too much noise.  I thought I would try these and wow, what a difference.  When these go on everything goes quiet, there is no hum, no background noise, nothing.  I was a little hesitant because of the cost, but now I am extremely happy.Also, these are a lot more comfortable.  After an hour wearing the Sharper Image my ears and head hurt.  With these I can keep them on 1 hour and feel nothing.I tried ordering from Amazon but they would not ship them to Hawaii, so I ordered them direct from Bose for the same price with free overnight shipping."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these headphones about 18 months ago. I used them most every day. I don't listen to music loudly and the headphones just sit on my desk when not in use. I think I take relatively good care of my things.Today, the left ear started making a hissing noise. If I wiggle the cable connector (the plug that inserts into the headphones' jack - not the computer/device end) the left ear starts to work for a few seconds and then goes back to making the hissing noise. The hissing noise is the same exact noise you hear when wearing them but noise cancelling is turned off (no sound from device and a muffled background noise). If I unplug the cable all together and turn noise cancelling on, only the right ear works. The left ear sounds like noise cancelling is turned off. This bit of self testing suggests the jack inside the headphones has a loose connector or the left speaker is blown/on its way out. This isn't something a new cable will resolve (which are relatively cheap and I wouldn't mind shelling out for). Bose apparently only warranties their products for a year now, so I am SOL.EDIT: After more playing with it, I have determined the issue is in fact a blown speaker. See below for a potential fix you can perform for less than a penny, but know it is only a temporary fix. You will need to re-position the fix quite often.For 300 dollars, these headphones really should have lasted a lot longer than they did. I'm rather upset. I had always been told Bose produced quality products that would last generations / not just months. That's why I ultimately chose these over the competitors.While they worked, I loved them. The sound was great, and working as a software engineer with loud fans all around me, the noise cancelling was heaven-sent. I talked them up to everyone, including my CEO. I guess I have to backpedal on all that now.EDIT: I found a fix on YouTube for the issue I had. I am not upgrading my rating as they shouldn't break in the first place, and this isn't a true fix, but more of a patch - it doesn't last forever and requires re-positioning on occasion. If you have the same problem, try searching YouTube for this: ""Repair your bose headphone with a piece of paper"" posted by ""Sebastian Gatica Moris"". Instructions are in Spanish, but easy enough to follow."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I bought these about 2 years ago, or the version they were selling then.  The sound quality is good but not, in my opinion, good enough to justify the price or to equal other high-priced headphones.  More importantly, the earphone cushion material is coming apart.  I only use these headphones occasionally (travel and sometimes at home, though I prefer speakers).  The cushion material is flaking off badly and getting all over me and my clothes.  My daughter has a similar problem with her &#34;overear&#34; Bose headphones bought only 1.5 years ago."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I got my Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones just before leaving for Brazil, a 10-hour flight there and 11 hours back. I'm a long-time frequent flyer and I really should have gotten them long ago, but I kept balking at the $300 price tag. As it turned out, I had a fair amount of Amazon gift cards on my account, and used them for the purchase. Suffice it to say, I'll never go without them again.First, the comfort factor. On both flights, I had them on for nearly the entire duration, whether I was actually listening to music or a movie or just wanting a little quiet for sleep. The headphones never became uncomfortable.As for the audio quality, well, they're Bose so the sound is fantastic. Now for a word or two on noise cancellation. In my experience, noise cancellation is most effective in blocking constant, droning noises, such as the rushing background noise you hear during a flight. The QC15s perform in this area very well. But oddly enough, I could still hear PA announcements, and I heard them even better because the background noise wasn't there to drown them out. Likewise with the passenger seated next to me...I was able to carry on a conversation even with the headphones on. So if you're expecting to hear pure silence when wearing these you might be in for a surprise.The QC15s come with two separate cables, one just for audio, and one to use for both audio and telephone, if you have an Apple iPhone. The iPhone cable is great for audio in that it has an integrated volume up/down and reverse/forward switch. But using them for a phone call felt a bit odd to me. Maybe it's just something that takes getting used to.All in all, a great product, and probably even worth the $300."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am a private pilot and own a Bose X aviation headset. It is an excellent product and worth the $1,000 I paid for it 7 years ago. It has excellent noise-cancellation capabilities and is so comfortable that I frequently forget I'm wearing it.It was with this background that I purchased their QuietComfort 15 headset. I work in a noisy 'cubicle farm' environment where there is a constant background noise from scores of development PCs and their cooling fans. Think Dilbert without the laughs.  I was hoping that the QC 15 would give me some relief and I was not disappointed. When playing music or soothing environmental sounds the QC 15s literally take you to another world, dampening the annoying fan noises and giving me much needed peace.If that was the end of the story it would still be worth the $299 price tag, but it gets better. Just for laughs, I took the QC-15 up in my noisy single-engine airplane and did an 'A/B' comparison against my Bose X headset. I was totally blown away when I found that the QC 15 was almost as effective as the dedicated aviation model in masking all the low-frequency propeller noise.  This got me to thinking that it was a pity some smart company hadn't created a 3rd party device that added a microphone to the QC-15, thus creating a discount aviation headset. Some research (Google is my friend) revealed that a smart company *had* done just this. For a very reasonable price they sell a boom mike that plugs into the standard QC-15s jack.So now I have a great headset for work and home use as well as a second aviation headset for when I take passengers up for rides. Talk about your win-win situation and ultimate bang-for-the-buck. This is a great product."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I usually listen to music at my computer in my den.  Unfortunately, the wall next to my desk is shared with the laundry room.  When the washer or dryer are running, the hum of those machines always intrudes on the music I'm listening to.I had Bose QC2s which served me well for years, but finally died.  I couldn't bring myself to spend the $300 for a pair of QC15s, so I tried Grado SR80i headphones... good sound, comfortable, durable, but didn't cancel out the noise.  I tried a pair of Monoprice noise canceling headphones.  The packaging and construction were first-rate, the noise canceling worked &#34;okay&#34;, but the sound quality just wasn't up to the Bose standards.  Even a pair of Bose AE2i headphones I received as a gift just didn't quite cut it.  The sound was good, of course, but the lack of noise canceling (and the seemingly inferior bass level) still left me wanting.  I tried a few others, too, looking for something with the noise canceling and sound quality I wanted.Finally, thanks to a used deal here on Amazon, I was able to pick up a pair of QC15s.  Life is good again.  No more noise from the laundry room.  No more hum from my computer.  Without music playing, blessed silence is all I hear.  I'm alone with my thoughts.  With music playing, I hear every detail of the music and vocals, without the addition of the rinse cycle or the monotonous hum of the dryer.I know that there are audiophiles out there who knock Bose for one reason or another, and while I respect their opinions and the reasoning behind them, the Bose QC line has always been the gold standard for me.  My music sounds great, and the noise cancellation is superb."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My previous pair was a JVC that I also purchased on Amazon ( much lower cost ) . This time when I was able to afford a Bose I decided to go for it . And it turns out to the best decision ever.The sound quality is amazing it does really tune out all the ambient noises and lets you listen to the crystal clear sound , whether it be music or watching a video or anything else.Sometimes I just want some peace and quiet while programming , and maybe not even listen to any music. Wallah , this pair of headphones does that , my JVC didnt . You dont even have to plug it into a source. Just put them on and turn them on to tune out ambient sound , best thing for concentrating on some thing without distractions.I am removing one star for a single reason of not being able to operate it without turning the noise canceling on. That is if you run out of battery while you are on the move thats it , you are done for , you cant use it until you get another battery. So carry spares always ."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"It's amazing! I can reduce external noise and concentrate on whatever I am doing. All that staticky background noise disappears but I can *usually* still hear when people are speaking directly to me. They are comfortable over my ears, though on long-haul flights my head starts to feel kind of sore. The batteries last quite a long time and usually start making a clicking noise before they go entirely dead, so don't assume they are broken if you start hearing that. I can hear movies and music very well on noisy airplanes while using them, but often just flick them on and leave them unplugged to take advantage of the sound barrier it appears to create. Have I effectively turned them into really expensive earplugs? Yes... maybe I have. But only 50% of the time.I use these:- on the plane& in noisy airports- at work around loud machines- when surrounded by small children- anywhere I am trying to read- when the neighbors at my hotel were throwing a 4th of July partyI love them. The only downfall they have is their size, which makes it hard for me to rest my head comfortably to the side on airplanes or when lying down unless I have a pillow or something soft and flexible to organize around my head. Even with that detriment, they are still a travel staple."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If you have never heard the noise cancelling feature of these headphones you are missing something!The sound from background noise is totally muffled whether you are listening to music or not.Very relaxing!The actual speakers are as good or better than other non noise cancelling headphonesA bit expensive, but worth it!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Honestly, if you've never tried noise cancelling headphones before, try some out. It's just amazing.I use them at work since my office has a noisy kitchen area on one end, construction noise on the other, HVAC noise from above, and computer fans from below. With just the noise cancelling active, I can't hear the HVAC or computer fans. At all. It's like magic. I do need music or white noise to completely obliterate the rest of the noise, but even then, I almost always have the volume at one notch above mute."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"First up I will admit that I'm not a DJ, techno-wizard, or anything similar.  I am a person that travels a reasonable amount and sometimes ends up in some not-so-quiet locations.  I have found these headphones to be excellent.They are simple to use, with easy adjustment for either on-aircraft or off-aircraft use.  I have worn them for long periods without them feeling hot.  I prefer the over-ear design (particularly for protracted use).  I recently used these in some cramped accommodation that had ambient noise from a refridgerator, laundry and external generators; these headphones created an oasis of listening pleasure even at low volume levels, I had to turn the sound input off and even then it was difficult to hear the external sounds.If you are in a particularly hot location while wearing the headphones there may be some persperation where they contact your skin for a long time; pretty much like any other product on the planet when it is held against your skin under similar conditions.Prior to purchasing I had read that these headphones tended to ""push bass tones forward""; perhaps they do.  Bass is noticable with these on, but this was never such a problem for me that I even bothered adjusting the source output.Additionally the carry-case provided is actually a functional and useful product, unlike many of the cases that come standard with headphones.Overall so far I have found these to be an excellent product for listening to music, movies and podcasts."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"it was really hard to justify the extra cost, but listening to the demo in the Bose store convinced me that this is in a league of it's own.  The music that sounds so shallow from my iPhone sounds amazing in these babies!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"quite functionalreplacing the battery is kind of a painthe build quality is not as good as other headphonesoverall, they're awesomeI'd recommend it to someone who wants peace and quiet."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"We purchased Bose QuietComfort Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones in Bose store in (no-sales-tax) New Hampshire so we can try them out. The prices for Bose headphones we looked at are exactly the same in the store as they are on Amazon. For the bargain hunters the store also sells returned models at a $40 discount. The sales clerk told us that they are inspected and tested to perform as new.We compared two models Bose QuietComfort 15 and Bose QuietComfort 3. The two models were displayed together (Bose QuietComfort 3 is $50 more expensive). The displayed made us think that they might be similar. Bose QuietComfort 3 are lighter and do not cup the ears as well. As the result they did not perform as well.The headphones felt very comfortable to both of us, both of us got a nice fit without any adjustments. I did not feel my head was squeezed like with some other headphones. Headset cord is detachable if you want just noise cancellation you can remove the cord. The headphones come with a case to protect headphones while you travel.WHITE NOISE-----------The store has a set up that allows you to test the headphone in a noisy environment that simulates the airplane noise.Bose QuietComfort 15 - fantastic, totally blocks the soundBose QuietComfort 3 - could still hear it somewhatVOICE-----------I have tried Bose QuietComfort five-six years ago to see if I can cut out human voices for a noisy cube farm environment at work. But back then the I could hear the voices better with the headphones on then with the headphone off as the white noise cancelation made them more clear. This time when I put them on and asked my husband to speak to me I heard nothing just saw his lips moving. I actually thought he was playing a practical joke on me, and quickly lifted the headphone to catch him in his prank. But no, he was actually speaking. I ask the sales clerk about this dramatic improvement, and she said that human voices are much harder to block as their range is less predictable but Bose have made some improvements in this area. However Bose still does not advertise the headphones as voice canceling headphones as some voices may not be canceled as well.Bose QuietComfort 15 - excellent, some voices cannot hear at all, others are very muffledBose QuietComfort 3 - could still hear voiceMUSIC-----------Bose QuietComfort 15 - phenomenal at all ranges, best sound I ever heard in headphonesBose QuietComfort 3 - ok, the sound not as richBATTERY:-----------Bose QuietComfort 15 - standard AAA battery, 35 hours on play on one chargeBose QuietComfort 3 - rechargeable Li-ion battery, 25 hours of play on one chargeBose QuietComfort 15 headphones were a clear winner in each category. When I recently asked my husband if he has been using his new headphones a lot, he said he loves them but does not use them while he works as he cannot hear the phone. Funny, the phenomenal sound isolation at work!Ali Julia review"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The noise cancellation is great and they're comfortable.  That's about it.  You're paying for the Bose name.  I thought that I would have better sound with these than with my old Philips headphones and after about a minute of playing, I decided to return them.  I own a pair of SHN9500 Philips noise cancellation headphones that sound far better in sound quality, as well as they don't require the headphones be turned on to listen.  I'm looking at my Philips headphones thinking ""I'm sorry ... what was I thinking?""  Like what was mentioned before, the speaker material is sensitive to pressure and the sound changes when pressing the phones near the ears and even crackle (like if you're laying down).  Mine actually have a distortion, muffling sound out of one of the phones.  Not the quality I'd expect from Bose.To all that are happy with their's, have fun.  I'd implore you to try a pair of SHN9500's if you can.  Or not ... maybe you won't want to feel cheated either."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My office is located in a building that used to be a factory or a beer brewery at some point. Very high ceilings, festooned with two industrial-size air conditioners and adorned in large pipe work, produce never ending hum, which reflects from the walls and concrete. Whoooooo is what I hear all day. The noise level is high enough to drown out conversations two cubicles away from me. This hum is most irritating especially when you try to concentrate on programming software.The UPS Man arrived with my package from Amazon and I promptly extracted these headphones from the box. Popped the battery in put it on my head and flipped the switch. The silence is deafening. All hum is simply cancelled out. Just like that with a flip of a switch it was off and staid off all day. Interestingly enough I could still hear people talking near by, but all the hum and ambient noise simply went away. When at the end of my working day I took the headphones off my head I was surprised how loud the normal ambient noise is at the office.Listening to music in these headphone is also a joy. I do not have to crank it up loud to drown the ambient out. And the sound quality is very very good.The headphones are comfortable and soft, but perhaps not so comfortable if used in a room with 75F temperature because the ear pieces are closed of course.These headphones will not do you much good at a rifle range or if you work next to a pumping diesel engine, but they work well to cancel ambient sound. You can still hear normal conversation though it is muffled.This product does exactly what it say on the box."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"The best headsets I have ever owned! The noise cancelling feature is awesome! One point though, you cannot turn off the noise cancelling feature, it will turn off the headsets and you won't be able to hear anything. I have not had my battery die yet but I'm guessing that when my batter dies I won't be able to use the headset until I put in a fresh battery. Other than that buy on!!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Amazing headphones. They weren't cheap, but you pay for quality. Using them on flights (in place of the usless airline ones) gives a fantastic sound quality, eliminating all sound around you."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"There are enough reviews out there comparing various aspects of the QC 3 versus the QC 15 that I'll keep this review relatively brief and focus primarily on a comparison of sound quality.  Simply put, the QC 15 has a very noticeable advantage over the QC 3 when it comes to sound quality.  Because I purchased these headphones primarily for use when flying, I really wanted to like the QC 3 because of the smaller form factor and (slightly) more compact case.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't get past the relatively poor audio quality from the QC 3 headphones.  The headphones otherwise seem well designed, and the noise canceling feature seems to work well, but the audio quality was frankly disappointing.  I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality of the QC 3 was noticeably worse than the QC 15.  The best way I can describe it is that music sounds very flat, with no depth of sound stage.  The QC 15 is not exactly the best sounding headphones out there (hence, only 4 stars), but they provide noticeably better audio quality compared to the QC 3."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I guess I had really high expectations for this headphone, right now I am a bit disappointed.Noise canceling feature is great, but when you have too many varying elements of noises around (unlike a constant noise generating A/C or airplane motor), the quietness it introduces can easily become a restriction on its performance. Interestingly, and most likely unintended, the hissing noise in ATH-ANC7 filters out some of those noises. If you can get used to the hissing, then it may become a more distraction free listen. The reason I am mentioning all these is because ATH-ANC7 works great if you want to listen to music at a low volume. Bose, because of its synthetic silence and unnatural sound, does not give the same comfort.Sound quality is another feature where I am also a bit disappointed. For some reason, the clarity suffers as I decrease the volume and it does not feel like listening to a good headphone in a quiet (and to some extent acoustic) environment. At high volume, it works well enough, though it gets really uncomfortable after a while. What I can say is that its sound feels heavy (which some may consider as noticeably unnatural). For many of the albums that I listen to, I get the feeling that the sound is not right. This is where ATH-ANC7 definitely wins for me. I can use the Audio Technica all day long without any feel of discomfort in the musical pieces that I listen to. I have to give regular breaks with Bose, if I want to have a long experience (and even that does not help too much).Other than that, I think the design is cool. The cables look interesting and having low-high feature in sound is another interesting feature. And even though it is light and it does not cover your ears tightly it achieves a really good noise canceling performance.At this price, I would like to see a much better performance in sound quality and hopefully they will manage that with the next version(s)."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Got these for my long 13 hour flight. They were very comfortable. I wore them for almost the whole flight. The noise cancellation was very good. I wasnt able to hear the planes engine or the many babies that were crying near me on the flight. Sound quality is also great. Good bass but not overpowering in anyway. I like the fact that they come with the inline remote with mic that works with apple devices and also worked with samsung galaxy s3 except for the volume controls. Also comes with carrying case, extra cord without the remote/mic. The battery life is advertised as 35 hours from the one AAA battery. Didnt get a chance to test it out but still have enough to power the headphones after the 13 hour flight. I do have a few gripes about the headphones. They are expensive. Especially at $300. But if you fly alot or need very good noise cancelling headphones then these are the ones to get. I guess your also paying for the bose name for the most part. I do wish that I could still use these headphones passively without turning on the power or using battery. This is a feature in the AKG N 490's which also cost $50 less than the bose headphones. Overall great noise cancelling headphones and will probably last a lifetime given the bose quality and how well I take care of them."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"They're quite comfortable--sort of: they're loose, and they move around, so it feels like they're going to fall off. They do a decent job with mid range. Bass is dramatically overdone. Trebble reproduction is an odious, smeary cacophony and the reason I returned them.Update:Twelfth time's the charm... Got a pair of Sennheiser HD25-1 II. They sound great (even with a lousy source like a smart phone) and block noise quite well without ""noise cancelling"". They're also quite a lot cheaper than the QC 15 and all parts are replaceable!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I am impressed by Bose in all ways, I have had a bose home theatre for close to 5 years but then I needed a nice headphone so I bought the Quiet Comfort 15 and this is the best thing I did.Don't settle for less. Its worth the price."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I travel a lot on long, overnight flights with all the attendant noise you'd expect on a plane. These keep me sane. You can put them on and relax in your own cocoon of quiet. Buy them, take them on every trip, and when the babies start crying, or seat mates play their music too loud, or the pilot likes to narrate the trip, you will thank yourself immensely."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"If you like your music loud you will hate these. I replaced them with Beats Studio but I think even those are gonna be returned as they feel cheap and I dont like the image/aesthetic of rap. (Different review) These Bose really cancel sound- its realy what u are paying for. ...even wind noise which most noise cancelling headphones can't manage these handle amazingly! however the bass is distorted and at the full vollume of my IPOD all frequencies are heavily distorted (and most bass even at low levels sound pretty bad). These are definately not for dubstep/trancestep (low frequency dives) or metal with double bass drum kicks. These 'phones may be fine for classical or mellow quiet use, definitely airline or other travel uses & some other location with a consistant droning outside noise. Very light & comfortable but genre dependent as far as sound pressure level and quality at higher volume."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"When it comes to noise cancellation Bose always stands ahead. Even though they have on-ear and in ear noise cancellation variants, I still feel the around ear more comfortable."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have owned quite a number of headphones over the years, including Dr Dre Beats (broken like most people had issues with).  Great sound, nice and big ear cups, long battery life!  Love them!"
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These sound no better than $25 dollar Sennheiser HD 202 II. And the build quality is no better either.Comfort is slightly better but for $300 more (tax included)... No way!Noise cancellation is not any better either than $25 dollar Sennheiser HD 202 II and the Senn's are just passive noise isolation. Plus with the Bose you need batteries.These headphones are a complete rip-off for $300. I would only pay $20-$30 dollars for these. No more.Look into some other brands like Sennheiser. They are a respected German audio company which caters to all budgets. For $300 dollars, you can buy Sennheiser's which will completely eat these overpriced headphones for lunch.They are other brands too. Please do your full research if you really are going to drop $300 on a pair of headphones because these Bose ones are all just marketing hype for uneducated consumers. You are not really getting $300 worth of sound nor worth of noise cancellation."
Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones,I purchased these for my son who is a minor league baseball player and so travels long distances on a cramped and noisy bus late at night and early mornings.  He has used a lot of headphone and said that these are the absolute best set of headphones he has ever had over his ears.  He told me that on the plane ride back he missed the drinks/snack because he could not hear the stewardess asking him what he wanted (which is really a good thing).  He tells me that the noise cancelling is the best he has ever used bar none.  Makes his trips so much easier/quieter/peaceful now.  He told me they are well worth every dollar spent.  I have tried them and can attest to the comfort and noise cancelling ability of this unit.  Would highly recommend.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"This mouse is a good mouse except for the picture is deceiving. The picture shows an all black mouse, but when I got it the mouse was a two tone color grey and black. This is the reason I gave this product only a 3 stars which if it would have matched the picture I would have given it a 5 star rating."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Hard to believe this is a Microsoft product. The buttons work OK, and it is a reasonably comfortable fit for the hand, but when you click the left button it sounds like a child's Cricket Clicker, much too loud. And it squeaks. I'm already looking for another brand of mouse."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,One of the most comfortable mice I've used. Great value for the price. I actually got another in a different color for my husband and he agrees.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"After 15 minutes of using this mouse, my right hand ached.  I'm on a computer several hours a day, and I generally have no issues with using a mouse.  This one has no contour to it whatever.  It's a semi-elipse.  Those with huge hands might like it.  If you're used to a contoured mouse, this one probably won't be what you want."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I find the mouse to be very comfortable and easy to use.  It is replacing a logitech mouse whose buttons were harder to press (more resistence) - the buttons on this mouse click easily and quickly.  The scroll wheel is easy to use and in nearly all things, the mouse lives up to the promise of being comfortable, consistent, and easy to use.I rate it a 4 star instead of 5 for two reasons:  1) the buttons when clicked are very loud.  My spouse has commented that it is annoying and he can hear it two rooms down when I am on the computer.  2) the scroll wheel doesn't click in sections - it just rolls freely.  I prefer a mouse with a scroll wheel that stops on a click after a full rotation.  It makes it easier to scroll when you have sections.Otherwise, I am very pleased with this mouse.  It replaces two Logitech mice that were too annoying to use."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,I had this mouse assigned at work and i loved it so much so i had to get one for myself at home !
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,i personally find this mouse to fit my hand really well.. and whats up with the haters who dont like smooth scroll wheel.. smooth scroll wheel totally rules.. get with the program.. the back and forward buttons are great and surprisingly microsoft has software for mac that makes this thing programmable.. cool beanz
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I bought 2 of these, and each makes a loud ""click"" noise when you click one of the buttons.  One of them must have a broken spring in it because it makes a sort of ""ping"" noise, which is louder but totally different from the other mouse.  If there are other people in the room with you it is very annoying.  The cord length and functionality are great, but the clicking noises make this a poor mouse."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Best mouse I've had.  After getting a replacement Apple mouse and trying others I finally found a winner.  Responds with a light touch to the wheel...many settings & compatible with my IMac.  Can program buttons as I wish with my Mac.  Especially like the back and forward buttons.  Like it so much I bought a spare!Update...3/11 - mouse acting squirrelly.  No squeak, neither mouse squeak or squirrel squeak, but erRATic behavior.  (Hope it's just this one, 'cause I bought a couple more.)"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Bought two of these, they work OK however with time it seems the chemicals from your hand effect the rubber material that the side grips are made from and deteriorates the rubber, leaving spots where your fingers are in constant contact. Logitech products do not appear to have this same issue. Does Microsoft even test there stuff anymore?????  I think the consumers are becoming the test dummies.  This defect should have been caught during Microsoft testing.  Both of these mice I bought have this problem. I recommend Logitech Mice as I have no problems with them."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,This mouse is identical to the gray mouse offered by Microsoft and it's less than half the price. So who cares about color? This mouse works exceptionally well. The blue laser works on everything except pure white. It also has four buttons and the scroll wheel has tilt control as well as the center switch. Plenty of function for most people. I bought two in case my dog eats one or my grandkids dunk it in their milk.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"as a mac user, since valve corp released steam and it's games for mac! I was looking for a cheap alternative of apple's mighty mouse ""wireless"" because the lack of accuracy and since I don't use it's features a lot! this mouse solved the problem, not to mention quicker at browsing the web! works on any surface! although it's a little awkward to me to see a PC equipment on a mac computer! this one is an exception!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I bought this for my wife who had problems using a tiny travel mouse for long periods of time. It was a perfect fit for her as she should stretch out her fingers.  The mouse plugged in and immediately worked with no problems. Good price, good buy"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,I have two of these for use where space is an issue. I use them with a lap top and a note book.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,20 bucks for a mouse that made it less than three months. The FileMate costs around 7 bucks and lasts me about a year. The wire frayed and loosened after about 7 weeks and the whole thing went south a week or so later. Time for a new one; this time it will be another FileMate.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I bought two of these. I got the ""Strawberry"" color because it was the cheapest. It's actually a light pale pink, so it's not too garish. They mice function quite well and they are comfortable for my small hand. There are two buttons on both sides of the mouse that are fully customizable."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I started using this mouse recently and have started liking it. There is nothing bad about this mouse and all its features work excellent. I recently stopped using my wireless keyboard and mouse because of it connectivity/sleep activation and precision issues in case of mouse (wireless). I ordered Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 Keyboard as it was the best available wired keyboard from Mircosoft. Strangely it wasn't sold along with a mouse of same style and looks. So after looking for a while, I came across this mouse and thought of giving a try. They both go well looks wise. Following points would describe its pros and cons;PROS:- Professional looks. Excellent styling and looks.- Quality material. It has a mat finish and not glossy.- Guaranteed precision pointing. Perfect movement and precision pointing which was one of the reason I moved to wired components.- Scroll wheel is amazingly smooth and works perfectly fine. Important point to note is, download its configuaration software from [...]Once you install this software cum drivers, you can configure the scroll wheel according to your requirement. I read reviews about scroll wheel not working properly but it's incorrect. Horizontal and Vertical scrolling works absolutely fine. Though remember it's a smaooth scroll and there is no clicks when you scroll vertically. I love it.- Left button and Right button can be set in the configuaration software to ease our tasks. The default assigned purpose of these buttons is to go Forward and Back while browsing.- So called its BlueTrack technology works well on wooden desk, paper and leather like material. Though keep in mind the mouse works on a light beneath it, so it won't work on transperent glass or mirrored surface according to the manual.- Plug and play, No hassel. Basic feature like vertical scroll and pointer started working out of the box. For all other extra features install the software from the above link.- Fairly priced, may be on the cheaper side.CONS:- Personal opinion: the width on top of the mouse is bigger than most of them available in the market. I have a small hands though it's not a big deal, I may get used to it soon.Overall:As expected from Microsoft, this product is a well built product with pro looks and that is why I prefer Microsoft over any other brand (even Logitech). Yes it costs more but what you get is what you pay for. I am a Software Engineer and have ordered this mouse for daily use at home. No more the mouse sleeps or looses its smooth pointing and also no more battery issues.Though I recommend not to forget the installation of the software cum driver from Microsoft's website. Check out the images I have uploaded. So far satisfied. If I found any issues, I will update this review.Happy pointing and scrolling :)."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"the mouse tracks very nicely, but I find the wheel totally horrible.  It rolls readily & totally smoothly -- i.e. no ""clicks"" and no resistance whatsoever -- ironically making scrolling far from effortless.  After correcting for the vague over- or underscrolling that's to be expected en route to the desired scroll amount, one has to be very careful/attentive not to brush the scroll wheel and inadvertently scroll more when placing a hand on, or removing a hand from, this mouse.One reason I got this mouse was because of the tilt-wheel switches, but I don't use the side-tilts for the same reason:  inadvertent scrolling during lateral movement.(Inadvertent scrolling is also an issue to be careful about when using the wheel to middle click.)After enough accidental clicks of the side button; they're now disabled, too.  .... or maybe not.  I just reached to do something with the mouse, inadvertently both moved the wheel *and* touched a side button, and found the text size on the page suddenly got bigger.  Bizarrely, I find I can only make text bigger, not smaller!!! so hopefully I can resolve this by revisiting the configuration SW.Also, you have to download the SW from the web.  Fine; but the web site provides 2 software components for this mouse, and installation of the second fails, as it says a newer version of this SW is already installed on my Win7 box.  I can't find that 2nd package in my start menu nor in the installed programs list, so I don't know what's up with that.Also -- and I don't know if this is something in Google Chrome or with this mouse, but -- I find Chrome's responsiveness to this mouse slow.  This is something I never noticed with my previous mouse -- or any other mouse/app combination ever before on any machine, for that matter.  for example, I middle click 2 adjacent links to open them in new tabs:  the 1st link opens in a new tab, but -- even though I clicked it while the mouse cursor was over it -- the 2nd middle click is processed as if it occurred in the space between the 2 links.Bottom line recommendation:  find something else."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"What can I say, this is a great, 'strawberry' mouse.  I don't mind the color and at a significant discount to the black one.  It works well, I would recommend this line of mice to anyone and everyone!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I will leave my original review intact below, but after a year and two months I became fed up with this mouse and bought a new one. Here are the reasons why:First, while the construction felt sturdy, it did not hold up. The black part of the body is covered in rubber which soon began to break down. It now looks terrible, pitted, and worn.The other major flaw of this mouse is the scroll wheel. Rather than the rubber coated wheel I am used to it has a wheel with a rubber band around the outside of it. This band soon became malformed and would come off the wheel, interfering with the scroll mechanism. Not long after that, the rubber itself began to break down, leaving gooey, black clumps behind, often gumming up the scroll mechanism. The problems with scrolling were just not worth continuing to use this mouse. Microsoft used to make excellent mice, but I have moved on to other companies now that they have stepped down their game. What happened to the quality of the Intellimouse?I also never really did get used to the free scrolling wheel, though I did like it in some situations.If you're looking for a good mouse check out the Logitech G400, it is what I replaced this one with. I'm sure that Logitech's other offerings are of similar good quality.----------Original review:I got this mouse to replace the Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical that I have happily been using for years now. It had become my favorite mouse but they have stopped making it so I had to find a new option. Having used a few notebook mice I knew that a small mouse was out of the question for my big hands--extended use of a small mouse makes my hand hurt so I had to look for a full-sized option.I toyed around with the idea of a full-sized wireless mouse but was unable to find one that had the button configuration I was looking for and I was concerned with weight and reception quality, so I decided to go for a wired mouse and the Comfort Mouse 4500 has a similar button configuration to the old IntelliMouse Optical (five buttons: the two normal ones, middle click on the scroll, and one on either side for forward and back in the browser). In addition to this it also has the horizontal scroll on the wheel which I thought might be a nice, if rarely used, feature.First impressions:Size - The size of this mouse is great, similar to the one it replaced. It fills my hand perfectly so I think I'll have no problems using it for extended periods of time.Shape - The shape is a little more squared off on top, which is a bit less comfortable for my ring finger than the curves of the IntelliMouse optical.Button layout - The side buttons are much smaller than on the IntelliMouse Optical, but still very convenient to my thumb and ring finger. The middle click button under the wheel is very firm, I wish it was a bit looser. (It may become easier with use.)Wheel - My one complaint about this mouse is the wheel. It has a free-scrolling wheel rather than a stepped clicking wheel. While this *is* better than the very firm click some mouse wheels I've tried have had, it is a bit disconcerting at first. The free-scrolling makes it very hard to ctrl-scroll zoom websites accurately. Perhaps I will get used to it. The free-scrolling combined with the firm middle click means that I tend to scroll while trying to middle click which could, perhaps, lead to problems.Side scrolling - I've never used a mouse with this feature and I don't foresee using it a terrible lot. I imagine it would be useful for large spreadsheets and such. It isn't a very natural motion to me (perhaps I would have said the same of scrolling fifteen years ago?) and since the wheel is free-scrolling it tends to scroll vertically a little bit while I'm using the side scrolling.Tracking - The BlueTrack technology seems to work well. It tracks equally well on my cloth covered mouse pad, wooden desk, and a glossy book cover. The only thing I tried on which it wouldn't track was a mirror. The response is perfect for me and I've got the pointer speed set about where it was for the last mouse I used. Precision seems excellent.Other - I like the overall look of the mouse, and the fact that it doesn't have the annoying extra LED that they used to feel was needed to let everyone in the world know you were using an optical mouse. This mouse only has two ""feet"", larger than the four mice of the past have used, and that seems to work just fine. Maybe they won't come unstuck from the bottom as quickly. I like the rubberized grip (the black part is rubberized).Final thoughts:This mouse is a great replacement for a full-sized mouse with similar button layout. It fits a large hand perfectly and is also ambidextrous for those who need a left-handed mouse. The only major drawbacks are the free-scrolling wheel and overly firm middle click button. The slightly angular design of the body is a minor drawback.Pros - Size (perfect for large hands!), ambidexterity (for left-handed mouse users, of which I am not), button layout, tracking, look.Cons - Free-scrolling wheel, firm middle click, angular design not comfortable (a bit ironic considering the name, but you can't please everyone)."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Cute and well made, my girlfriend loved it.Fwd and Back buttons are nicely positioned and you dont hit them by accident.The mouse is thicker than you think it would be (more bulbous) and works very well!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I bought this mouse to replace another Microsoft, the 1058, thinking I was buying a wireless mouse. My mistake, no fault of the manufacturer. So, right off the bat, I don't like the cord. It's constantly rubbing over something on my desk (which is not that neat!), a sound that bothers me, or gets caught on something, which slows down use of the mouse. It's also made of some sort of soft material -- rubber? -- that is perpetually sticky, even after I try to wipe it down. For ergonomic reasons, I wanted the longest mouse I could find, but this one is short and fat enough (height-wise) to cause me pain in my wrist. I've rigged up the old mouse receiver with adhesive poster putty to create a wrist rest so that my wrist isn't constantly in a bent position. It's a pretty clunky solution. I've been looking on ebay for a 1058, which is no longer made, but so far no luck. I hope to replace my old mouse soon!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Overall this is a pretty sold mouse, especially for the price.However, if you use AutoCAD or any similar program that uses the wheel button as a click-pan, this is NOT the mouse for you.With or without the extra software, clicking the wheel will pan, but there's a lag of about 0.1-0.2 seconds.This sounds trivial, unless you're drafting at full speed, then it's maddening and useless."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I got this as a new mouse for a new system I built. (all amazon parts!) I like the way the sensors are set an an angle so that you can use in on various surfaces.as I &#34;upgrade&#34; my other computer systems, I will be buying more of these!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,This was a gift for my Honey Love. This is a fairly big mouse for a female hand. She says it fits her hands great. We bought this mouse as a replacement for a wi-fi mouse. I highly recommend this mouse. It tracks well and was easy to install. Excellent buy for the price.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I love this mouse! It is very cute, but also very good quality, and the settings are very simple to change! The scroll wheel sensitivity was awful when I plugged it in, and I just slowed it way down and it is perfect! Good gaming mouse, too. Love this!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"For what I paid , this mouse is doing a great job.Very accurate and comfortable for photoshop.I'd definitely recommend this product to others."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,Use this mouse as a spare in my travel laptop bag. Works like a charm on any surface. Plug and play with both Windows 7 and windows 8/8.1.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Bought this mouse for work.  We use laptops on docking stations.  While I have a wireless mouse, it is a mobile one, so a littlre smaller in size.  I wanted a full size mouse for where I do a majority of my work.  Wired just makes sense in that situation, as its always plugged into the docking station.The mouse has a great ergonomic shape and contours to the hand very nicely.  The two extra buttons on the side are great for foward and back, or can be customized if you choose to install Inetellipoint software (comes with mouse or download from MS).  The mouse behaves great.  Have had it for a couple weeks now.  The only complaint I have is that the wheel is not a click wheel.  There is no resistance in the scroll wheel at all.  I prefer to have the wheel click.  Also, the wheel is smooth, no grips.Overall though, my two complaints arent even enough to drop from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I love this mouse."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I went to the Microsoft website looking for an ergonomic wired mouse. They recommended this mouse to me.This mouse sucks. I'm close to throwing it in the trash.1. The middle button response is very laggy. Most of the time, I need to click it 3 times to register 2 clicks.2. The scroll wheel is overly sensitive. It doesn't feel good even when scrolling web pages.3. The mouse cursor too much when I lift it off the table.Really! I am better off using the trackpad on my laptop. First, the media keyboard and now this. I am very disappointed in Microsoft hardware lately."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Mouse arrived as promised. It works great as a good mouse should. The color is awesome, my wife and my daughter are delighted with it. And the price was the deal maker, so keep up the good work."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I needed it for my laptop, as my pad is about to give up the ghost. After looking around for a bit, I decided on this one for the price, and the supposed comfort of the design. It didn't let me down. It fits exactly into the palm of my hand. As I use my computer for hours at a time, especially for editing, this is perfect for me. Comfort counts!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I normally use a naga gaming mouse because it has so many buttons i can macro.  However, it has had a glitch with the system that i would have to re-plug it every time i turned on my pc.  Got tired of doing that so I bought this very simple and basic mouse and I am absolutely pleased with the performance. Even though I lost 12 extra buttons by switching to this mouse I will bear with it because this new mouse is so smooth and accurate. I love how the wheel glides and it tilts as well."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"This is a good mouse.  Very accurate tracking.  It has a similar button layout to an Intellimouse.  So if you are used to the 4th and 5th button locations on opposite sides like the Intellimouse, it will feel natural.My only complaint is the scroll wheel.  It feels tight and smooth when moving, but it is not smooth on the screen.  It is jumpy and catchy. It will sometimes jump back a little bit after you have moved it, even if you are carful not to move the wheel back.  It is difficult to keep it accurate. When used for gaming it becomes really problematic.I wanted the newer tracking technology, but I am considereing going back to my old Intellimouse strictly to regain the accuracy of the scroll wheel."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I love this mouse. It's very comfortable to hold and very precise. Takes no time for me to get used to it. The scrolling wheel is very smoooth. I understand the complaint of hte wheel click as a middle button, but I never used it, so it doesn't bother me. the Most often used buttons other than the main 2, are the forward and backward buttons. They are not as big as the original MS optical mouse side buttons, but they are less likely to be clicked accidentally. So far I love this mouse and have no complaints."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Nice color, good variety of buttons, but absolutely the worst scroll wheel experience around. It'll scroll up unexpectedly while scrolling down. Sometimes it'll start scrolling all by itself! and the center click and double center click features work only when they want to. An absolute nightmare to work with in photoshop.I don't like this H.I.D. (Human Irritation Device). Sending it back right away!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I just love the five separate, programmable buttons. And the new hi-res laser and detector work great on any surface, even shiny ones. It's also light and glides easily. No flaws at all, really. Great mouse."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"This mouse is replacing an old Apple Mighty Mouse. The mouse is very comfortable and tracks accurately. The scroll-wheel is &#34;loose,&#34; it doesn't click or buzz when you scroll. Sideways scrolling doesn't work very well on Mac (scrolls very slow). I'm used to using &#34;shift&#34;+scroll so it's no big deal. Its a little tall for my hand, but much more comfortable than a Mighty Mouse. I like the rubber material.It gets 4 stars because the sideways scrolling doesn't really work."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I like the Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500. It fits my hand nicely. The key pads are responsive. The scroll wheel is a little fast, so it takes a little time to get used to it.I like this mouse better than my Microsoft Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer that gave out after a few years of service.All in all, this is a great mouse with a solid warranty! What more can you ask?Best, Jim"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,This mouse is well made and has a nice design. Its a little larger in the palm area which I feel makes a great resting place for your hand. The wheel has a great feel and its super accurate.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,Works well with my Mac and a nice compliment to my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard. I can honestly say money well spent.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Purchased this from amazon on Sep 1, 2012. The rubber on the base of the mouse and on the scroll wheel started falling apart around February. As of April 24, it is in completely unusable condition."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Feels great in my hand....also, very responsive.  The price cannot be beat!  Order one just to have a spare around when you need it."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"The Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500 does the job I need.  The last mouse I had did not work well so I decided to go with a wired instead of wireless to see if that was better.  And, it is.  Also, more comfortable."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I do like this mouse. The scroll-wheel aspect that others have mentioned, the &#34;smooth-scroll&#34; feature, is pretty obnoxious. Forget art/photo editing, and gaming takes quite an adjustment. The buttons on either side are way too easy too click, but you adjust.That said, it feels nice with a slightly-rubberized grip (the black section), and is a great size for my hand (large-ish for a woman, but smaller than most men). The color is a NICE pale pink (not too &#34;Barbie&#34; or red or kiddish), and it has a comfortable weight to it (neither heavy nor light). I wouldn't be embarrassed to have this sit on my desk at work, either, unlike many of the pink mice I've seen for sale. AND, it's wired! I'm not a fan of Bluetooth mice, so this is nice.I'd definitely recommend this mouse. For an &#34;adult-looking&#34; pink functional mouse, I'm very happy I found this!"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,A basic mouse.  Works like a mouse should.  I bought 12 for a business.  No complaints since it does what it should.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I liked the original Intellimouse alot, but mine was getting pretty oldfor the $8 including shipping (Prime) on this Microsoft product, with the same laft and right 'go back' 'go forward' buttons I was used to, I decided to give it a flyIt's great! I mean, there are more expensive mice out there with better ergonomics perhaps or maybe not this goofy pink color, but who cares, for an $8 brand name mouse which works flawlessly with Windows, is very smooth an accurate, and at this price, how can you go wrong (you cant)If you are looking for an under $10 mouse that you want to be sure will work and is of good quality I challenge anyone to find a better answer"
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I purchased this for my mother to use with her laptop.  As has been mentioned, the middle wheel button can be hard to depress and it can feel a bit odd with the smooth scrolling wheel.  Overall, it is a great mouse for the price and works very well for normal use."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,he likes it. Says it works good. Happy with it and not minding the wires on it at all. :)
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Can't complain. Got this for a good price, expected something really cheap, and got something I'd consider twice as valuable for the price.Great tracking, excellent feel, good button response. Can't go wrong."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Both products failed to have the mouse function.  This was using computers with brand new motherboards and new chipsets, new cpu's.  Have bought Microsoft mouse products since they became available years ago.  All previous mouse products had packed with them a driver for the mouse.  These products had a very complicated method to download drivers from Microsoft.  Spent a day working with those downloadable drivers.  Still do not have a working product.  I do admit that on one particular computer that I built around 10 years ago, the model 4500 would work as a mouse.  But no operation on relatively new computers.  Testing was done with Windows XP and Windows 7.  If I get these to work after a few days of fiddle with the mouse, I will describe the problems IF it is possible to get the units working, and on multiple computers."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,don't like the feel and the side buttons are on the sensitive side ... the wheel doesn't work like some of the others I've had.  Looks good on the screen but just wasn't the mouse for me.  I wouldn't buy another regardless of the price.
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I was looking forward to this, as it's the model Microsoft currently makes that most resembles my beloved and discontinued Comfort Mouse 3000.I've used many mice with extra side buttons, and have never had any problems. On this model, I was baffled to find that Microsoft decided to move the side buttons up to virtually the same positions where your fingertips hold the mouse. I'm a reasonably dextrous person&#8212;I play several musical instruments, and am a fast typist&#8212;but I could NOT use this mouse without regularly and unintentionally pressing the side buttons. What could be more distracting than clicking things you didn't mean to, or having the context menu pop up unbidden?A disappointment. If you're considering this mouse, be sure to find one you can try first."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I've never used a mouse I've totally loved, but this is as good as any I've had.It would be worth full price, and if you don't mind an odd color,  you may be able to get it for less, I got a red for under $10.Smooth operation, very quiet. Middle button (pushing down on scroll wheel) is a little hard to push, might be an issue for someone who uses that a lot- I don't. Left/right buttons seem a little cheesy, but no problems noted.Got two, one for work and one for home, so I don't have to get used to different mouses (yes, mice)Be sure to download drivers from MS, easy to find, for full operation."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I have become used to using side buttons on prior mice. Unfortunately I can no longer find the old models I've gotten accustomed to. This mouse is OK, but it is not ergonomically designed. The side buttons are not where my fingers normally expect them to be."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"Bought this to have a cheap, temporary mouse until I could afford a nice gaming mouse.Plugged it in to multiple USB ports, tried to download the drivers for it, but nothing worked. Mouse was DOA.Even if it did work, the mouse scroll is horrible and I can see that the other reviewers are correct, this mouse wouldn't survive long.I am extremely proficient with computers, having built dozens of systems and maintained many more over the last fifteen years."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I had been a very happy Microsoft Intellimouse user for years.  Recently the left button on the mouse started acting up so I decided it's time to replace the mouse.  I could no longer find the Intellimouse online or at any local stores such as Best Buy, Target or Staples.  At first I bought a Logitech Wireless mouse M510 and found it heavy and less responsive than a wired mouse (I guess this should be expected since it's wireless?)I then purchased this Comfort Mouse 4500 at a local store and this mouse is a disappointment.  The mouse feels too big and is too high for resting my palm comfortably.  The wheel makes very loud noise when using middle click and is rather hard to press.Microsoft please give us back the high-quality Intellimouse!  I am more than willing to pay the higher price for its quality, functions, ergonomics and feel.Skip Comfort Mouse 4500..."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,"I needed a new five button mouse and have had good luck with Microsoft mice in the past.  The Comfort Mouse 4500 sounded like it would be the right mouse for me, despite the somewhat negative reviews here.  I though ""How can a Microsoft mouse be as bad as this one sounds?""  So I bought one, figuring it would be just fine.  It is not.Like quite a few reviewers say here, the scroll wheel is a pain; there are no detents in its travel and simply moving the mouse can cause the wheel to scroll.  I use the middle button A LOT and trying to click it when the wheel ""slips"" provides a horrible experience.  The back button is also place too far forward to be useful; I have to rotate my entire hand clockwise to get my thumb on the button, which pushes all of my other fingers off their respective buttons.  A better way of placing the back button would be to have its front edge placed where the current button's trailing edge is now. The forward button on the right side of the mouse happens to be too far rearward to be effective. If its trailing edge were where the current button's leading edge is, it would make for a usable button. Maybe making the mouse smaller would also help, as buttons couldn't be so far apart from one another.These negatives combine to yield a mouse that is effectively a three button mouse, and a not particularly good one at that.Will I return it?  No, because the mouse cost only $10 and I hate the pain of having to repackage everything and stopping at the UPS Store.My search continues."
Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500,Wheel started to bind up. Found it impossible to open unit and clean it out. Good news is that it is cheap enough that I simply bought another one. Performance very competitive and versatility is excellent.
