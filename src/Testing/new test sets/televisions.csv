(I suggest after purchasing the TV to go on the VUDU application and search for Disney's: A Christmas Carol trailer.,Other,
")).Sound: The sound is pretty good on this TV (no complaints), and what I really like is that you can't see a single speaker on the thing!",Product,Feature
"********************************* UPDATE October 27 2013 *********************************Still the best 65"" 3D TV out there.",Product,Feature
"************************************I ""almost"" and would have bought from amazon, but came across an ""open boxed"" item at a local store for hundreds off retail.",Other,
**SEE UPDATE BELOWThis is my second 3D HDTV.,Other,
**UPDATE 6/20/13*************Could not be happier with this set.,Other,
3D looks like you could walk right into the screen.,Product,Feature
"A downside to the remote control is that it IS NOT universal, so it won't control your cable box or anything.",Product,Feature
A replacement was not available from Amazon so I opted for something different.,Other,
Absolutely a stunning picture.,Product,Feature
"Active 3D requires heavier (battery powered) glasses, that have shuttering lenses, to flicker and block out images at certain points.",Product,Feature
"Again, uses the non-powered movie theater type 3D glasses.",Product,Feature
"All the movie channel apps you want but seldom find all together in one single TV.Heavier when compared to the typical 65"" LCD tv's.",Product,Feature
"And that in itself was stunning to experience vs the usual 1:85 screen sized so called wide screen tv's.Add in the large selection of built-in apps including VUDU, AMAZON VIDEO, HULU-PLUS, and NETFLIX.",Product,Feature
Appears frameless.,Product,Feature
As if you are there with your own camcorder doing the filming.,Product,Feature
"Based on the reviews I saw on Amazon, I decided to purchase the VIZIO M651d-A2R from Amazon and had it delivered via CEVA.",Other,
Below are some positives and negatives about the television.Appearance: This TV definitely has the WOW factor.,Product,Feature
But it is still wonderful!,Other,
But the fact the tv is 240hz as opposed to 120hz makes a huge difference.,Product,Feature
"But when I could save $350 more off the asking price with local in-store ""open-box"", well... what can I say?Planed on wall mounting.",Other,
"Close the drapes, and reflection was eliminated.",Product,Issue
"comparing to other leading brands such Samsung, LG  & Sony, this Vizio's picture quality was noticeably inferior.",Product,Feature
"Cool in a way, but very obvious difference compared to 120hz tv's.Other than that observation, this vizio 65"" is fun to watch, a nice 65"" big screen, nice features, very responsive.And I still can't get over the thin bezel surrounding the screen sure does add to a near frameless picture, and how that makes the picture even more stunning.",Product,Feature
Could not pass that deal up.Amazon does great at delivering big tv's.,Other,
"Discovered after some time getting annoyed with the remote, that by now I was sure was broken, that the tv's pickup sensor on the tv was located very low on the screen edge.",Product,Feature
Don't know the difference?,Other,
First this player is not smart.,Product,Feature
"Floor carpet was blocking the tv pickup sensor.After power-on, going thru the on-screen guided tv set-up of the Wf-Fi connection, and going thru the online registration, all was fine.",Product,Feature
"For once I am totally happy with a TV, and 3D TV at that.",Product,Feature
Got it today,Other,
Great design on the remote control.,Product,Feature
Hard to explain.,Other,
"Having not connected to a video source yet, I went into the tv apps first off, VUDU.",Other,
Honestly I was very hesitant to buy an LCD TV.. Let alone a &#34;discount brand&#34; like Vizio.,Product,Feature
"HOWEVER... when setting the screen brightness to ""vivid"" in the menu, you can hardly detect any reflection.",Product,Feature
"Huge difference 55"" vs 65"".And since this vizio M65 screen does pretty much extend edge-to-edge, with the tiny small frame around the picture, the tv looks practically like there is no frame at all.",Product,Feature
"I also have an 55"" LG I did buy from amazon.",Other,
I am hoping Vizio's 4K will not repeat my disappointment.,Product,Feature
"I do not like the stand it comes with, but that's not a problem since we mounted our TV.",Product,Feature
I have had TV now for about two months.,Other,
"I personally love these, as it takes no navigating to open up Netflix or Amazon video!",Product,Feature
I read all the reviews on this TV and I decided to buy from amazon glad I did works and plays great no problems and picture is great.As others reviews state the remote sensor is the only problem but I have a logtech remote that I use which makes it no problem.3D also works great not much of a 3d watcher and I did not buy for that reason.,Product,Feature
"I realized something I had thought was only applicable to the 240hz  LG brand tv's,  had thought that LG gave a more realistic sharp crisp picture than other brand Tv's.",Product,Feature
I really do not see that here.,Other,
"I recently purchased the 65 inch Vizio M series, and after 2 months of use, I must say it is really wonderful.",Other,
I returned my 60&#34; LG 3D after it arrived broken with lines in the image.,Product,Issue
I thought our den was plenty dark but the windows are not shaded and the glare on the screen during the day was unbearable.,Product,Issue
"I was hoping for a reasonable priced & high quality HDTV in this Vizio, but was disappointed when I saw it in person.",Product,Feature
"I will say that when we are viewing a SD (standard definition) channel on our cable service, there is some light bleeding at the top of the screen (small pixels of white light).",Product,Issue
I'm having serious buyer's remorse over this one and we plan to take the TV back to Best Buy and probably buy another Samsung.,Other,
In a way it takes away the mystery of film and acting.,Other,
"In other words, don't hard knock this tv just because you fear reflection issues.",Product,Feature
It almost seems like the TV has no bezel.,Product,Feature
"It has passive 3D, which in my opinion, is much better than the active 3D of many other new TV's.",Product,Feature
It is really sleek!,Product,Feature
"It makes for a little difficulty when mounting the TV and running cables through the wall, but not a major complaint.Picture: The picture on this TV is outstanding.",Product,Feature
"It retails for around $250.00SMART TV Features: The apps seem to be all here, and they work just fine.",Product,Feature
It's like you are there while they were filming.,Product,Feature
"It's not easy to see, but it is pictured in the manual, which interestingly is not printed but accessible in the TV menu.Either way, it's a great TV for the price, but I only have it for one day, so hopefully it will hold up.",Product,Feature
"It's the 240hz effect, I guess, since both my 240hz tv's share this video clarity.",Product,Feature
"Just set to the picture to ""VIVID"" in a bright daylight room, or close the drapes and reduce the picture brightness down to ""standard"".But VIVID does give a stunning picture, regardless.The 3D...This vizio M65 3D-TV uses the ""passive"" 3D system to deliver great stunning 3D viewing, meaning it uses the very same NON-battery powered 3D glasses used in 3D movie theaters of today.So you can collect as many 3D glasses as you will ever need.And if the kids should break a set, no big deal.",Product,Feature
Kind of like making a home movie.,Other,
Mounted on the wall and used the in-wall TV wiring kit to run and hide the wires in the wall.,Other,
No huge financial loss.,Other,
Note: Vizio does also offer a sound bar to go with the TV on their web site.,Product,Feature
"One important note: Even though this TV has passive 3D like the theaters, things don't tend to pop/jump out as much as they do in the theater.",Product,Feature
"One of the BEST options for this WORLD CUP !BIG SIZE, Great Image, full of functions.3d works PERFECT.Sound is not the best, but if you plan to use it with a Amplifier ... no problem!Less many, more size, more functions, greeeeeaaaaattttt IMAGE !",Product,Feature
One thing I don't like about the build is that the HDMI and other component inputs are on the opposite side of the power adapter on the back of the TV.,Product,Feature
"Pro's-----Clear, snappy, bright, wide-color pictureExcellent white field uniformityExcellent clarity - sharpness processing is refinedGood text legibility as computer monitorHeavy/solid constructionThin frame makes photographs look like a window in darkened roomVery energy efficientContrast 7600:1 measuredExcellent motion resolution with three settingsRelatively wide viewing angleBright 3D with lightweight glassesBright white was factory calibrated to 6500K standard in Dark Room modeGood value - if reliableCons----Benefited from automated color calibration.",Product,Feature
Probably because the frame around this tv is so thin.,Product,Feature
Produces a life-like picture.,Product,Feature
"Pros: acceptable remote control, nice 3D, good number of inputsCons: lower quality, defective out of the boxModel Number: M651D-A2I researched extensively Vizio, Samsung, LG, Sharp.Unnamed club -Costco-, of course, offers price and warranty advantages.",Product,Feature
"So opened the box, sat the tv on the floor with not yet using stand, just to first test everything out, and discovered not getting tv response from the remote (which is a backlit-keys remote).",Product,Issue
"Tested both standard quality tv, HD quality and finally 3D quality using VUDU, I realized this tv was stunning in all aspects.And YES, this screen size (65"") is plenty big, having come from a 55"" screen I wondered if the added screen real-estate would be worth the screen size upgrade?IT WAS !!!!",Product,Feature
That manual power-on button worked.,Product,Feature
"The bezel is extremely slim around the screen, and it is a really nice look.",Product,Feature
"The build seems extremely sturdy, and the TV frame is manufactured out of some nice metal.",Product,Feature
The colors really pop.,Product,Feature
"The controller has 3 buttons dedicated to certain apps: a Netflix button, amazon video button, and another movie application button.",Product,Feature
"The design is beatiful with just a thin bezel.Fantastic picture quality, the pictures are so clear bright and crispy.3D effects are awesome.Sound is great.The only con....but nothing that can hurt the TV.",Product,Feature
"The floor carpet I rested the tv on, standing up and leaning against a table, that the tv's remote sensor was being blocked by the tall carpet.Gesh... One of those days I guess.So the remote was actually working and indeed fine after all.",Product,Feature
The glasses for active 3D are also SUPER pricey.,Product,Feature
"The image quality is awesome, and even though the LG (7400 series) has full rear LED backlighting with local dimming, I don't see any difference, flash light effect or anything for that matter, but I also have the dimming function turned on.3D is great, not any different than on the LG, but my wife pointed out that it looks sharper, not sure if thats the case as I thought the LG looked great as well.Now, the remote does in fact suck, but since I am using the Directv remote for regular viewing, it's no issue.Also, people mention that there is no physical on/off switch, that's not true.",Product,Feature
The only way to do 3D in the home.,Product,Feature
The quality is incredible and the price too.,Product,Feature
The screen size of this vizio is NOT your typical 1:85 big screen ratio.,Product,Feature
"The sides of the TV bezel are sliver, and look great against the wall (we mounted ours).",Product,Feature
The small VIZIO tag in the bottom left corner of the TV is not a distraction at all.,Product,Feature
"The Smart TV features are somewhat slow to respond to your input on the remote control, but not horrendously slow.",Product,Feature
"The thing is, vizio as well as my other 55"" LG both have 240hz and both share the same crystal clear picture.",Product,Feature
"Then I discovered the small on-off button on the TV ""backside"" at lower left.",Product,Feature
"There is a small button on the rear left (looking from the front) which turns the TV off if hold pressed down, or switches the inputs if just pressed briefly.",Product,Feature
This is a true movie theater 16x9 wide screen.,Product,Feature
"This is a wonderful 3D trailer to show off the 3D to your friends, and this particular trailer has some images that do jump out at you (snowflakes!",Other,
"This only happens on very few standard definition channels, usually when they are airing commercials.3D: The 3D on this TV is also fabulous.",Product,Feature
This tv is a great value for the money.,Product,Feature
This TV is very good except for the really really cheap 3D glasses and so........,Product,Feature
"This Vizio is a great looking TV with all the specs & features, but fall short of my expectation in picture quality.",Product,Feature
"This Vizio TV not only has great picture, it looks classy on the wall due to the very thin outer frame.",Product,Feature
This was in a bright daytime room with a wall of windows.,Other,
"This will be short, I love the look of this TV at night, must be viewed in a dark room, dark enough so you can't read anything.",Product,Feature
TV viewing and screen reflection was not an issue.,Product,Feature
UPDATE 3/6/2014Over the update came during the day.,Other,
"Very solid build.And the pretty much totally flat TV back-side, so this TV can be mounted closer to the wall with the correct 3rd party wall-mount bracket for slim tv's.Fully built in Wi-Fi, ""Not"" an USB add-on dongle.",Product,Feature
"We have a blu-ray player, and stream HD movies from amazon and Netflix, and none have seem to disappoint as of yet.",Other,
"Well, this VIZIO uses the same type of 3D as movie theaters, called passive 3D, which simply means you can put on a pair of light weight glasses and enjoy the show (8 pairs of glasses included with the 65' model).",Product,Feature
What a great TV.,Product,Feature
What this boils down to is more of a headache and a less pleasurable experience when viewing active 3D.,Other,
"When we have friends over, they always mention how nice our TV looks.Build: A lot of people say that VIZIO makes cheaper televisions.",Product,Feature
Why no remote response?,Product,Issue
Would not power-on the tv.,Product,Issue
WRONG!,Other,
Yes the screen is a glass substance where it reflects a bit.,Product,Feature
"You can find plenty more of these 3D glasses for only pennies each.And having no battery or expense to deal with using 3D glasses will mean pure 3D heaven.I cannot believe or imagine why anyone would get anything other than passive 3D.Passive 3D delivers the same excellent 3D viewing experience.And after all... it's good enough for the movie theaters to use.One reason I wanted this particular TV was reading the aspect ratio being that of the movie theater ratio of ""true"" wide-screen 16x9.",Product,Feature
You have to experience it.,Other,
I must say I have never experienced such OUTSTANDING Customer Service!!!,Customer Service,
"After seeing my review, TCL asked me to contact them regarding the problem TV, stating this was definitely an uncommon issue, and they wanted to do everything possible to remedy the situation",Customer Service,
I was asked to send the defective tv directly to TCL and not back to Amazon so TCL could troubleshoot and make every effort to resolve the problem.,Customer Service,
"But, I can definitely trust that there will be GREAT customer service if I ever need it from TCL again!",Customer Service,
The 1 star is due to poor initial setup and VERY POOR customer support.,Customer Service,
Called customer support and gave them the case # and reported the new problem.,Customer Service,
She walked me through the setup (which I tried 3 times already) and finally concluded I needed the upgrade on a USB stick and they would send one out and receive it in 3 to 5 business days.,Customer Service,
She also offered to send the data through e-mail and I agreed to that thinking it would be faster.,Customer Service,
Great customer support Hisense - will wait to see if this is all resolved before the 30 day return time is up and will update this review if things improve,Customer Service,
I ended up exchanging a cheaper 4k TV (500 for 50in) for this one (650 for 55in) because when I got the cheaper one it was broken upon delivery,Product,Issue
The television arrived with a badly damaged screen.,Product,Issue
It was so disappointing to set up this TV only to turn it on and see a completely messed up screen,Product,Issue
I  bought 2 of these tv's and both turned out to be broken!!!,Product,Issue
One came in completely cracked and the other just updated then shut off and still never won't turn back on but the 4 year warranty is nice,Product,Issue
Tv came with hole in entire screen and could not be replaced only refunded.,Product,Issue
"arrived broken, box was not damaged, middle of tv smashed in",Product,Issue
The first TV came with a damaged screen. ,Product,Issue
The second TV also came with a cracked screen that was worse then the 1st one,Product,Issue
The television arrived with a badly damaged screen.,Product,Issue
"Screen was beyond damaged, it was simply destroyed.",Product,Issue
Talk about lack of respect to customers. ,Customer Service,
These people are dinosaurs from the dark ages and have absolutely no respect for their customers.,Customer Service,
Also with no customer service to right the wrong.,Customer Service,
But I've dealt with Sony's customer service before and it is the worst out there dealing with my PlayStation 4,Customer Service,
They will do anything to get off the phone including lie to you.,Customer Service,
There is some sort of irregular pink and yellow tint appearing as vertical bands that affect any white or grey content.,Product,Issue
"While black levels, image sharpness, interface and overran product design are unmatched, there appears to be some sort manufacturing defect making it past quality controls, if any.",Product,Issue
"The $5,000 TV is defective and after verification from an LG approved TV repair person that the unit is in fact defective",Product,Issue
"As a consumer who paid $5,000 for an LG TV that only worked for 3 months, this is unacceptable",Product,Issue
My only thought is I wish I would have found the 65 inch or maybe waited for something larger as my room could have handled a larger screen with a larger footprint.,Product,Enhancement
"It could have a bit more to it like more buttons on the tv, but for a perfect display tv at this price range, I can't complain.",Product,Enhancement
I just wish the sound was a little better,Product,Enhancement
Probably would have been better to put them with the remote or the setup instructions to keep them from becoming lost.,Product,Enhancement
"I wish the arrows were positioned higher on it, though",Product,Enhancement
I wish the volume was a bit louder but it's a wonderful TV.,Product,Enhancement
I wish it had the audio output to connect external speakers.,Product,Enhancement
I do wish they had an update for showing the program list (For over the Air antennas.),Product,Enhancement
Wish Samsung would include the screws for the back of the TV to mount it to the wall mounts.,Product,Enhancement
I wish however that we can connect via blue tooth a pair of headphones so the TV noise isn't heard by our bedroom (mom & dad).,Product,Enhancement
"Kinda wish it had a VGA input, still has HDMI so no real problem",Product,Enhancement
