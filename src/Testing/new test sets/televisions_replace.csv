Below are some positives and negatives about the television.Appearance: This <Product> definitely has the WOW factor.,Product,Feature
But <Product> is still wonderful!,Other,
But the fact the <Product> is 240hz as opposed to 120hz makes a huge difference.,Product,Feature

"HOWEVER... when setting <Feature> brightness to ""vivid"" in the menu, you can hardly detect any reflection.",Product,Feature
"Huge difference 55"" vs 65"".And since this <Feature> does <Descriptor>-to-edge, with the <Descriptor>, the <Product> looks practically like there is no frame at all.",Product,Feature

In a way <Product> takes away the mystery of <Feature> and <Descriptor>.,Other,
"In other words, don't hard knock this <Product> just because you fear reflection issues.",Product,Feature
<Product> almost seems like the <Product> has no bezel.,Product,Feature
"It has passive 3D, which in my opinion, is <Descriptor> than the active 3D of many other new <Product>'s.",Product,Feature
It is <Descriptor>!,Product,Feature
"It makes for a little difficulty when mounting the <Product> and running cables through the wall, but not a major complaint.Picture: The picture on this <Product> is outstanding.",Product,Feature

It's like you are there while they were filming.,Product,Feature
"It's not easy to see, but <Product> is pictured in the <Feature>, which interestingly is not printed but accessible in the <Product>.Either way, <Product>'s a great <Product> for <Price>, but <Consumer> only have it for one day, so hopefully it will hold up.",Product,Feature

"Just set to the picture to ""VIVID"" in a <Descriptor>, or <Descriptor> the <Feature> and reduce the picture brightness down to ""standard"".But VIVID does give a stunning picture, regardless.The <Product> uses the ""passive"" 3D system to deliver great stunning 3D viewing, meaning <Product> uses the very same NON-battery powered 3D glasses used in 3D movie theaters of today.So you can collect as many 3D glasses as you will ever need.And if the kids should break a set, no big deal.",Product,Feature
Kind of like making a home movie.,Other,

The <Feature> for active 3D are also <Descriptor>.,Product,Feature
