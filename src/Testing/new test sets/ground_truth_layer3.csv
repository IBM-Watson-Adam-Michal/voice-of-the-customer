There is no way to send audio out of this tv to a soundbar or AV receiver.,Enhancement

Better viewing angles would be nice.,Enhancement
Setup experience needs to be improved.,Enhancement
Needs more audio output ports.,Enhancement
A better way needs to exist for mounting this on the wall.,Enhancement
Why does this TV not come with WiFi?,Enhancement
A larger display would have been better,Enhancement
The setup instructions could have been clearer and less confusing.,Enhancement
The TV should be lighter than it currently is so that it is easier to mount,Enhancement
It should learn my favorite channels over time.,Enhancement
Great TV but would really benefit from a sturdier base.,Enhancement
If this TV had more apps I'd pay so much more for it.,Enhancement
I wish it had actual buttons on the screen to control it.,Enhancement
The remote should be made bigger since it's too easily lost right now.,Enhancement
Remote design needs to be more intuitive,Enhancement
More color options would be great.,Enhancement
A thinner bezel would make this the complete package.,Enhancement
I wish they offered this in 4K resolution.,Enhancement

A thinner screen would be nice.,Enhancement
A better way to change display settings that is faster and more intuitive would be a huge bonus.,Enhancement

Adding a harddrive into the TV would be a good touch.,Enhancement
"this needs to be designed better, it is just too ugly right now.",Enhancement

"The remote is pretty lightweight and feels somewhat ""cheap.""",Feature
Something that sounds small but will drive you nuts is the remote.,Feature
don't like the start up lag time.,Feature
native set sound quality isn't very good,Feature
terrible Android TV experience,Feature
Clearly their software is buggy and somehow messes up the Audio out.,Feature
 Sharp only lets you access the internet sites they picked - NO WEB BROWSING You can not access Amazon Prime,Feature
Buggy and troubled setup,Feature
The tv has really weak sound to begin with and you have to adjust it when switching from tv to other devices.,Feature
volume control sucks,Feature
 The stand consists of two flmsy plastic legs that are very likely to break off,Feature
the color on this model and the ability to adjust it leaves much to be desired.,Feature
"The built in Wi-Fi was poor,",Feature
Horrible audio quality,Feature
Poorly made. WiFi card is not grounded/will not connect to your wireless and there is no ethernet port to bypass this issue. ,Feature
We are lucky to get connected to our wifi at all on these and then the signal is perpetually dropped. ,Feature
"Over all it seems nice, but the motion blur engine is not quite up to par and you will notice some artifacts on live sports and news broadcast",Feature
The remote that comes with this unit is the worse remote I've ever owned.,Feature
Unfortunately there is noticeable input lag.,Feature
EXTREMELY slow and takes FOREVER to boot up after being turned on.,Feature
Very Poor Remote...takes a very long time to go between channels.,Feature
Terrible glare from light behind or from side.,Feature
Buggy smart software that crashes and reboots irregularly.,Feature
The most remarkable quality I've found with the television is its theater-like picture.,Feature
Set up is pretty much self explanatory and you have a minimal amount of selections to make and the TV does the rest to set itself up.,Feature
"I am impressed with the resolution and clarity, since this is a brand I haven't heard of. Visually very impressive, good clean resolution.",Feature
"The menu on the tv is easy as pie to navigate, with a nice sized remote with a clean simple layout.",Feature
" For me, it shows a decent enough clear screen for what I watch.",Feature
"This TV is awesome its easy to assemble and has very good audio,",Feature
"Low glare, excellent picture quality. We use this in a dorm lobby and sound is great! Definitely a good product for the price; especially in a place where we have to replace TV's regularly due to vandalism!",Feature
"The bezel is thin, and sexy. The set itself not thick depth-wise, but not too thin either. It weighs about 55 pounds and is easy to move around. ",Feature
"The TV is very good-looking, nice thin bezel, easy to assemble, and very light. ",Feature
Awesome TV! Great picture. Awesome veiwing angle. This TV is huge!,Feature
"Very crisp picture, even better with a Sony Bluray player. I have always liked Vizio, simply because of their customer support.",Feature
You can up-scale any video to have simulated 3D.,Feature
The 3D image is beyond compare. It is essentially the same as Real 3D in the movie theaters (in fact Real 3D glasses work with it). ,Feature
Fastest ON TV I've seen in a long time,Feature
Every time I watch a program or a movie I experience the beauty of this HD screen. It's almost as if you have been sucked in by the TV and seeing everything in real life!,Feature
Samsung has the blackest blacks and the whitest whites and the color are true and vivid. ,Feature
"the best, reliable, great picture, well built, all the necessary features",Feature
Very fast apps and processor. ,Feature
The TV is easy to set up and use. The picture quality right out of the box was quite good and I was able to enhance it by using the lab settings that Consumerreports.org has for this model on its website. ,Feature
"Very light weight so easy to hang, sharp picture quality, and pretty good sound coming from stereo speakers mounted in the bottom of the TV facing down. ",Feature
"his tv has been wonderful for me. The picture quality is above average, the settings we're easy to configure,",Feature
" It prompted me very intuitively. One thing I discovered a bit later is that under the center front of the TV itself, there is a switch",Feature
Has a true native 1080P capability in a small 22 inch LED monitor. Smallest available size with native 1080p for tight areas.,Feature
"Thin, light, easy to set up, navigation through menu is simple. Bright and colorful ",Feature
"I was hesitant because I had read the reviews and they were not great. I received my TV yesterday, and it has been great.",Feature
The feet of the base are fairly wide though it fit perfectly on a stand we had used previously for a 60 in DLP TV.,Feature
"My TV has a perfect refresh rate and a nice bright LED back-lit picture.. 3HDMI inputs, a component input and a regular good old fashioned AV (Red/White/Yellow)input make this unit very versatile.",Feature
"Size is great, and the bezel is very thin",Feature
Still and slow moving moments look great,Feature
"Picture options are surprisingly high for an entry level set, if you have a calibration dvd you are all set.",Feature
 had high hopes for this TV after reading the reviews but 5 minutes out of the box i got the base installed and attempted to turn it on to find the remote doesnt work with the shrink wrapped batteries it came with.,Issue
"On my specimen, there is noticeable back-light infiltration, initially in the lower and upper right corners. ",Issue
"Screen will go black, randomly for roughly 5 seconds.",Issue
We owned one for 10 months and went zebra striped. ,Issue
I would. I have had the tv for less than 6 months and it is torn up.,Issue
"Box was damaged, screen casing (black plastic that holds the tv in place) was damaged. ",Issue
When we turned it on the picture had crazy colored lines across and no image on the screen. ,Issue
The screen was broken.,Issue
That is until I got it home and realized that the TV had white spots on it. ,Issue
"That replacement worked for about 4 hours, then the screen started showing black, horizontal lines moving up and down the screen and gradually became worse until the television wasn't viewable.",Issue
"This television was working for about 24 hours worth of viewing, then the picture faded into bright green and white. Completely unusable.",Issue
Within the first month I was having issues with the video and audio not working. ,Issue
After about a week of that the audio went completely out. I contacted sharp and opened a case. It took them about a month but they sent a TV repair man out to replace the mother board.,Issue
had to return it due to large scratch on the screen,Issue
" I have put it to use just few days ago, and all of a sudden there was no Audio coming out from the TV's internal speakers, when I try to stream content from Netflix, Youtube or any other built in app.",Issue
"TV randomly reboots itself, sometimes a few times in a row",Issue
First issue was that on several streams there were odd green lines flickering on the screen.,Issue
After the third day I started losing sound when switching from Netflix to cable. ,Issue
There is some minor light bleed on the edges and you can see the led light zones on all black screens,Issue
sound making that horrible plastic speaker crackling sound after 45 days making it ineligible for return,Issue
Makes loud popping noises while fast forwarding and randomly freezes even while sound is still on.,Issue
"The plastic frame around the screen does not meet all the way around, leaving a horizontal line of light shining through on the top right screen area",Issue
TV sometime has no volume. No idea what is happening,Issue
I got a defective screen that I didn't notice until I saw an all white or mostly light grey screen and now I notice it all the time. ,Issue
Out of the box there is a large dark vertical bar right center.,Issue
Second tv came in and the screen is entirely busted!,Issue
Arrived broken.,Issue
Arrived with the screen broken where it meets the frame from poor assembly at the factory and an obvious lack of inspection. ,Issue
Worked fine for about a month (at which point it's ineligible for a return) then the picture started flashing in and out.,Issue
Huge discoloration on the upper left-hand side .,Issue
After two months the panel went bad; there is a 3-inch horizontal bar along the bottom of the television that flashes random colors.,Issue
wouldn't started yesterday with horizontal lines and today the screen is completely black.,Issue
"The first week of Febuary the scrambling and distortion began to get worse, lasting longer and longer, until it was only scrambling when you turned on the set. ",Issue
"Also, as of 1/18/2016 the TV now flickers slightly until I tap it on its side.",Issue
Dead pixels throughout and the right side of the screen was dead. Huge disappointment.,Issue
"But the annoying thing is, the first one I got, there were two gray shadow area at the low center of the screen, they were too obvious to be ignored. So after another week of waiting, I got a replacement. But I found there's a dead pixel surrounding by a 'bubble' underneath the panel, just right after I spent half an hour to get it mounted on the wall. It looks like a bubble under a window screen.",Issue
Not even four months later and there is a horizontal blue line on the left side of the screen.,Issue
"One month out of warranty, and a blue line randomly appeared on the screen indicating a pixel defect. ",Issue
"white lines on screen, poor quality pictures.",Issue
"80 days after purchase, the otherwise fine unit suddenly emitted a high-decibel static death shriek",Issue
bout 6 months in it started having display issues where the display would cut in and out until finally it just stopped working all together,Issue
backlight died after 7 months. ,Issue
Bought this tv 4 days ago it already went dead ?,Issue
Had mine about 10 months now and it now goes through this sequence of scrolling all of the TV inputs continuously.,Issue
"However, today Sunday April 24, 2016...vertical lines appeared on the screen from the center stretching to the right and patterns like a bar code.",Issue
"The picture was immediately grainy, snowy, had sporadic green flashes through the screen and occasionally a black screen.",Issue
After only having this TV for 1 month I noticed a huge line across the screen.,Issue
"I was very excited about getting my new tv, only to find out that the screen was broken.",Issue
it worked for a month and went black screen and no matter how much turning off and on or doing anything nothing would get it too work so i returned it...,Issue
