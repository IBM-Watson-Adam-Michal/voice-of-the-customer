"<Consumer> got my new UN65JS8500 last Tuesday after I accidentaly broke my <Product>, well accidents happens.",Sentiment
"Anyway, Samsung's <Descriptor> <Feature> are called SUHD.",Product
<Company> claims that <Product>-bit panels can produce 64x times more accurate color and sharper resolution thanks to the Nano Crystal color display compare to current 8-bit UHD panels from other brands.,Product
The JS8500 includes the One Connect Mini as oppose to the 9000 series which include the One Connect Box with more input options and future proof of the hardware.,Product
"Also this set has a LED Edge-Lit backlight display as his more expensive brother the JS9000, only",Product
the JS9500 has a Full Arrange Local Dimming capabilities that will have superior HDR performance.,Product
However the JS8500 will do a good job handling HDR but with <Descriptor> because of the <Feature>.,Product
"And last but not least is the obvious, is not curved but Samsung was extremely wise to keep the flat version only to the US market, but all of the other great features from the 9000 series are present.",Product
Once you properly calibrate your set be ready to be amazed.,Sentiment
"I watched The Dark Knight, Pacific Rim and Transformers 4: Age of Extinction, three of my favorite Reference movies on Blu Ray.",Sentiment
The <Descriptor> <Product> is <Descriptor> and use.,Product
I considered both the JS9000 & 9500 but I'm not a fan of curved TV's.,Product
I did way to many hours of research leaning towards discounted 2014 models as I'm basically done paying extra for being an early adopter of new technology.,Sentiment
In the end I just couldn't pull the trigger on settling for what my eyes perceived to be an <Descriptor> <Feature> to the JS8500.,Product
<Consumer> needed a <Product> now and am willing to watch the price drop in the coming year.,Sentiment
If your considering this TV my recommendation is go for it!,Sentiment
I'll update this review after I get more time using this TV.,Other
I've attached a photo of a youtube 4k video taken with my samsung S5 phone.,Other
<Consumer> purchased this <Product> about 2 weeks ago and I can't say enough good things about it.,Sentiment
The <Feature> is so <Descriptor> that it makes you wonder how you lived with 1080p beforehand.,Product
But I will warn you it takes some time of working through all of its features before you get this picture.,Sentiment
Out of the box it <Feature> <Descriptor> but give yourself an hour or so and you will not believe the difference.,Product
If you have a Xbox One or PS4 you will see a drastic difference as well.,Sentiment
I play Destiny on Xbox One and it looks amazing.,Sentiment
One thing you will have to do with FPS or action games is switch over to game mode every time.,Sentiment
Without this switch you will notice a substantial lag that will make for a not so pleasant gaming experience.,Product
Once you switch over to game mode though it looks amazing.,Product
The vivid picture does change a little bit but im sure it is to account for the refresh speeds.,Product
I did an awful lot of research before buying a <Product> in this price range and through all my reading I saw that <Feature> was extremely important to future proof your investment and this TV has it.,Product
The other model I looked very closely at was the new Sony model in the same 55 inch set.,Sentiment
Both had <Descriptor> <Feature> but the <Feature> coupled with the <Descriptor> <Feature> in my opinion I chose <Product>.,Product
I know many people say there isn't much 4K content out right now and that is fairly true.,Other
But I have watched a fair number or blu rays the past two weeks and they look stunning.,Sentiment
I turned on the UHD upscale and it creates a far <Descriptor> <Feature> than my prior <Feature> <Product>.,Product
One that was particularly amazing was Lucy.,Sentiment
The <Feature> are so <Descriptor> its hard to look away.,Product
The Samsung UN65JS8500FXZA TV arrived on November 12.,Other
They were serious flashlight issues emitting from the sides and bottom of the TV screen (see attached pictures).,Product
<Feature> <Product> is an <Feature> <Descriptor> <Product>.,Product
The edge lighting was clearly visible.,Product
<Feature> seems to be a <Descriptor> problem with this model.,Sentiment
I've seen other people complain about this issue online.,Sentiment
I filed a support ticket at Samsung.com and attached the images showing the problem.,Sentiment
I also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Sentiment
"After speaking to several people and being disconnected once, <Company> arranged to have a local authorized repair technician come to my house and replace the <Product> <Feature> on November 17.",Product
I was on the phone for a total of two hours with Samsung and their agents to get the entire problem resolved.,Product
"Now that <Feature> has been replaced, the <Product> looks <Descriptor>.",Product
I am very pleased with the final result.,Sentiment
"However, the TV screen should have worked when purchased.",Other
I should not have to replace a brand new screen.,Other
"For that reason, I give 3 stars instead of 5.",Other
"Okay, it is now December 30, 2015.",Other
<Consumer> have owned the <Product> for 6 weeks now and it works flawlessly.,Sentiment
The <Feature> is shown when seated directly in front of the <Product>.,Product
The image becomes brighter when viewed from the sides.,Product
I attached an image showing Home Alone playing on the TV.,Other
"Also, <Feature> is <Descriptor>.",Product
I didn't even buy the TV for the 3D capability.,Sentiment
But I am so happy I did.,Sentiment
You can convert any television show or movie to 3D.,Product
"It does not work on 2D cartoons, but it does work with everything else.",Product
I am super pleased with the 3D functionality.,Product
The UN65JS8500FXZA comes with one pair of glasses.,Product
I bought additional open box Samsung 3D glasses online at BestBuy.com for $9.99.,Sentiment
Please let me know if you have any questions.,Other
I normally look to upgrade every 2-3 years and this process is usually a very simple one - checkout the offerings from Sony & Samsung and select the best option.,Sentiment
"But the plan this time was even simpler - look for a great deal on a 2014 H7150/H8000 because the benefits of 4k are largely negated on the size I needed (46-50), and there are no high-end 1080P sets for 2015 in that size.",Product
"But other advances in technology, both those that are here and those that are arriving soon (hopefully) made this process much more involved and a bit befuddling at times.",Sentiment
I'm still not all that sold on 4k but the best <Feature> are only available on <Product> so you have to take a close look at what's available in this space.,Product
"And while 10-bit panels, wider color gamuts, nano-crystals/Triluminous displays, etc. are nice features, none of them would have changed my original plan for a 2014 1080P set.",Product
What did was HDR because I believe that could be a game changer.,Sentiment
"It also narrowed the search down to <Feature>, the JS8500 or <Product>, and I don't think you can go wrong with either one.",Sentiment
The <Feature> is <Feature> and has <Descriptor> <Feature> but neither of those was a concern for me.,Product
But it also has the full OCB for better future upgradeability so that was worth considering.,Product
"But you can't upgrade the panel, so I would rather use the $500 difference in price along with the future evolution kit upgrade ($400+) and whatever you can sell the JS8500 for and put that towards a <Descriptor> <Product> when the time comes.",Sentiment
"Anyway, it's only been a few days but so far I am extremely happy with the JS8500.",Sentiment
Setup was a breeze and the picture quality ranges from great to pick-your-own-superlative.,Product
<Feature> and <Feature> is <Descriptor> and I haven't noticed any motion lag.,Product
"Netflix/Amazon look much, much better.",Product
4k streamed looks better yet although not by much.,Product
But 4k with HDR might leave you speechless (as would <Feature>) and quickly became my gf's <Descriptor> feature (evil witch!,Product
Now there are a few channels that looked better on <Consumer> <Descriptor> <Product> (Samsung F6300) but they don't look that great to begin with so be prepared for a few sources that will disappoint.,Product
The sound is more than adequate for my needs and first impressions of Tizen are very positive.,Product
I'm getting used to the remote but it is on the small side and won't be suitable for some folks.,Product
But any of these can be easily upgraded and are not rating factors for me.,Sentiment
Now I'd like to mention a few setup/installation items that might save some folks a little aggravation and maybe result in more accurate reviews.,Other
"First, I did experience one issue with this set which was some flickering/flashlighting on the bottom of the screen that was very noticeable when watching movies in letterbox format.",Sentiment
But sometimes this is caused by the screws being over-tightened during the mfg.,Other
"process, so I loosened the 4 bottom screws by about a 1/4 turn (one needed more) and the problem has not returned.",Sentiment
Something to try before returning it.,Other
"Second, if you have satellite like I do (DirecTV) you should test your signal strength to make sure you don't have any issues because this can greatly impact picture quality on any set.",Sentiment
This is easily done under the Settings menu with DTV.,Sentiment
You also want to make sure the cable/satellite box is configured to allow the TV to do ALL the upscaling/processing.,Sentiment
With DTV this means Resolutions should all be checked with Native set to ON and screen format set to original format.,Sentiment
"I would also recommend turning off all of the following on the TV, at least initially - Instant On/ECO settings/Smart Security/Anti-virus.",Sentiment
"These can cause various problems with streaming, shutoffs, etc.",Other
so try these individually after you have everything else setup/dialed in.,Other
"Lastly, this might just be my imagination or another in a long line of senior moments, but the <Feature> seemed to improve noticeably after the set had about <Product> hours on it.",Product
I know they say you shouldn't professionally calibrate it until after 100 hours so maybe this is related.,Other
I also need to give a couple major kudos to Amazon.,Other
"First, they double boxed the shipment which is a service that some places charge $30-75 for and others don't even offer.",Other
"And second, they took care of me when <Company> not only extended the original sale past 6/13, but then included a free soundbar or 24 <Product> with every purchase.",Other
Still enjoying the <Descriptor> <Product> and decided to have the set calibrated.,Other
"I find this service to be a bit over-priced especially since I could easily do it myself if I had access to the right equipment, but in the end you get a <Descriptor> <Feature> - not a night and day difference - but worth it in terms of color accuracy and detail.",Product
A lot of people have reviewed this set in detail.,Other
"Rather than repeat that, here's a few words about the One Connect Mini box that is included.",Other
The One Connect Mini is much smaller than I had imagined.,Product
"The One Connect Mini is only <Descriptor> than the <Feature>, which is a pretty small <Feature>.",Product
You shouldn't have a problem finding a spot for this box even in the tightest installations.,Product
"This box is necessary to use the <Product> from any source other than the antenna connector, streaming services, or the <Feature> on the back of the TV.",Product
"The box features 4 HDMI IN ports, a digital optical output port and two USB 2.0 ports.",Product
The USB 2.0 ports are on the left edge (not shown in the photo).,Product
"<Consumer> think most people will use this <Product> with one or more HDM<Consumer> devices -- either an <Product>, set top <Feature>, <Feature> player, etc.",Sentiment
"For these to work, you must have the One Connect connected.",Product
"After initial setup, I got a couple of messages about problems with the HDMI connections.",Sentiment
I think these were due to the One Connect cable being loose.,Sentiment
"It's a tight fit, and you need to make sure it is firmly connected, with a final click.",Sentiment
"Once I did this, I had no more such problems.",Other
I've had the Samsung UN65JS8500 for 3 months now with no problems.,Sentiment
It has a <Descriptor> <Feature>.,Product
Some people have been hating on the remote.,Other
I'm pretty happy with it.,Product
"When you put your finger on the magic button, it becomes sort of an air mouse -- you can point and click items on the screen.",Product
<Product> seems <Descriptor>.,Other
I had an <Feature> where none of the <Product> were working.,Sentiment
"I thought maybe I would need a new one-connect box to fix this, but Samsung support (1) checked that I had the latest software, and (2) had me unplug the TV while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Sentiment
This cleared the problem.,Other
 <Consumer> bought this <Product> knowing the <Feature>.,Product
 hope this helps people looking at this TV and I am happy to answer any questions you might have as it is a big investment for most and the <Feature> can sometimes feel <Descriptor> to some.\,Other
"Hoping I was not one of those people, I ended up with that set.",Sentiment
"On top of that, the bottom left corner was not flush.",Product
Contacted Samsung and they deemed it to have physical damage from shipping and refused to repair it.,Product
I will not be buying another Samsung set.,Product
Their customer service is beyond horrible.,Product
They will do everything possible to deny a warranty claim.,Product
"bought this <Product> a month ago, and just returned it <Descriptor>.",Sentiment
(unless they were hiding with the stand.,Other
Lets get to the BAD part.,Other
"I can't believe that for a 2015 TV, and for this price, I would be experiencing this level of issues.",Sentiment
"The V<Consumer>zio M70-C3 i bought before this <Product> had way better backlight, with only 32 active LED full array zones, it out performed this samsung.",Comparison
"<Consumer> really wanted to like this <Product>, as I have a <Descriptor> Samsung <Feature> series from 9 years ago on the wall, and it is still a very <Descriptor> <Product>.",Comparison
"<Consumer> can't believe these two <Product>'s share the same tech for the most part, aside from the smart features, 3D, form factor, inch count and the nano crystals...I decided to go with the LG 65EG9600 to squash any of my gripes...and if that TV doesn't knock my socks off, I give up.",Comparison
"<Consumer> will return <Product>, and wait a few years.",Other
"However, it has some drawbacks that might be significant to you, and there are other televisions that are much cheaper that you might consider.",Sentiment
"First the pros: it has <Descriptor> <Feature>, which works well to convert content from cable tv and make it look very nice.",Product
"Some channels are startling in their quality with the <Feature>, others are good but nothing special, but all <Descriptor>.",Product
"Since there is not much 4k content at all, video processing is important.",Product
"Also the color is very impressive, properly calibrated this is another impressive aspect to this set.",Product
Some programs look fantastic color wise.,Product
"Lastly for the pros, <Product> is a very good looking tv, with real metal around the bezel and stand, and if you care about <Feature>, this is a <Descriptor> to have in a set.",Product
"Cons: this has a very <Descriptor> <Feature>, so if you have it in a room with lots of windows or light sources, be aware that you will see them reflected in the screen.",Product
"You can still enjoy the content, as the screen can get very bright, but if you are bothered by this be aware.",Sentiment
"Also, this set looks weak when you move off axis, worse than others I've had.",Product
"so if you have a large room where people will be seated far off to the side, be aware, the screen gets very washed out unless you sit in front of it.",Sentiment
"Lastly, since this is edge lit instead of back lit, black levels will not be as dark as with a back lit screen.",Product
"I find the blacks good, but not quite as good as my Vizio that is back lit.",Product
"So, overall for me this was a <Descriptor> <Feature>, but there are definitely <Descriptor> that might be important enough for you to not consider this.",Sentiment
"For me, the pros outweigh the cons.",Other
"As for competition, the Vizio M series is much cheaper than this, 4k and full <Descriptor>, with <Descriptor> <Feature> and other advantages as well.",Product
I would check that out for sure and decide which is best for your preferences.,Sentiment
IMO comparable Sony's or LG's are not worth considering.,Sentiment
Good luck.,Other
My 65 has a very obvious lighting glowing defect in the lower left and lower right corners when viewing light-colored content regardless of source.,Product
Looks like many other users are reporting the same thing with recently purchased TVs.,Other
Check out the Official JS8500 thread on AVSForum for a bunch of customer photos that highlight the issue.,Sentiment
I'm boxing it back up for a return.,Sentiment
Let <Consu<Consumer>r> start by saying that this <Product> is the <Descriptor> <Product> I have ever had.,Product
The picture quality is beyond what I expected!!!,Product
"I pick this up from Best Buy since they had there Black Friday prices available now, same as Amazon has it currently.",Sentiment
"I can't tell you how amazed I am with TV, the <Feature> are <Descriptor> for Samsung's entry level of the SUHD brand.",Product
"I originally planed on getting the LG 65UF8600, but I seen that LG has a lot of back light bleeding issues, and doing more research, I found that it is not to future proof or HDR compatible.",Product
"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge LG fan, my <Descriptor> <Product> before this was an <Descriptor> <Product>, with this <Product> I have no back lighting issues.",Sentiment
"I have only watched one 3D movie so far (Gravity), it looked amazing.",Sentiment
"I am mad that Samsung only decided to provide one single pair of 3D glasses, provided the amount of money we are spending ($2,000+), they could at least spare another 15 or 20 bucks and provide one more pair, guess I'll be watching by myself until I get some more!!!!",Product
<Consumer> have have two <Product> <Feature> connected.,Sentiment
"One to my 2014 <Company> BD-F7500 4K Up-scaling 3D Blu-Ray player, and the other to my <Product>.",Sentiment
"These HDM<Consumer> cables are the best, I highly recommend getting them, I had these for about a year now connected to my <Feature> <Product>, and they have done wonders for the <Feature> set.",Sentiment
"The cables are about a $100 a pop (plus tax), and they are worth it.",Sentiment
"I have one with the LED indicator ($10 more), which tells me when the signal is in SD, HD, or 4K.",Sentiment
"I've done some <Feature> <Product>, it doesn't need to much tuning though.",Product
All in all <Descriptor> <Product>.,Product
 The one connect box died just over a month after purchase.,Product
It will take samsung 5-15 business day to have a <Descriptor> <Feature> shipped to me.,Product
"If you were to order this tv directly through samsung's website, it'll ship w/in 1-3 business days, but the part that's essential to the tvs functionality takes anywhere from 5-15 business days?",Product
"This wouldn't be an issue if the <Product> had at least one <Feature> on the tv, but it doesn't so you're at the mercy of the one connect box.",Product
"If it fails then your brand new, <Price> <Product> is useless until a replacement box is shipped to you.",Product
like to be specific when I write reviews here as too often the reviews of multiple models/products get blended together.,Other
This review is for the <Company> UN24H4000 24-Inch 720p 60Hz LED <Product>; Amazon ASIN: B00KSBBGA4.,Other
"I purchased this product on Sept 6, 2014.",Other
<Consumer> have only used this <Product> for one day and at this time only have it connected to an older digital cable box via a coax connection.,Sentiment
I did use the <Feature> for a <Product> and the <Feature> is <Descriptor>.,Sentiment
<Consumer> will have a <Product> installed early next week and following that will have an HDMI cable tv connection.,Sentiment
I will update my review following that.,Other
<Consumer> now have this <Product> connected to a Tivo Mini and the <Feature> is <Descriptor>.,Product
If you are concerned about 720 vs 1080 I say don't worry.,Product
<Consumer> have a four-year-old <Company> 22 1080 <Product> in another location and the <Feature> from this <Product> is just as good if not better.,Product
The first thing I would like to say is that this TV does NOT have any input ports on any side panel as depicted in the photos.,Product
All of the ports are on a squarish panel on the rear of the TV and all face to the rear.,Product
"I point this out because if you plan on using a <Feature> (such as thumb drive) to view media, you may want to obtain a <Product>, because if you have the <Product> against a wall, or in an enclosed cabinet like I do, the <Feature> may not be <Descriptor>.",Sentiment
(Note that a USB extension cable is NOT the same thing as a standard USB cable.),Other
Another reason I point this out is the Amazon photos for this product clearly show a side panel with HDMI and USB ports.,Other
I am certain that the photos come from Samsung as the same photos are shown at BestBuy.Com and Beach Audio.,Other
"The recessed area for a side panel is present on my set, but is smooth plastic.",Product
Both the shipping carton and the product label on the rear of the <Product> clearly identify this TV as a <Product>.,Sentiment
It appears that Samsung has revised the panel configuration of this model to match the separate UN24H4500 model.,Sentiment
Both the Setup Guide and Quick Start Guide show the position of the ports correctly.,Product
"Set up was relatively simple, with the exception of a great deal of frustration mounting the TV to its base.",Product
This model comes with three documents: A Setup Guide; a <Company> tart Guide; and a <Product>.,Product
All three of these are fold-outs.,Other
"Even the <Product> is a <Descriptor>-out, is 16 by 22 in size when opened, printed on both sides, and printed in tiny print.",Product
"Fold-outs are <Descriptor> for the <Feature> and Quick Start guides, but I would much prefer a booklet style User Manual.",Sentiment
Mounting to the base takes three screws installed through a relatively deep cavity on the underside of the stand.,Product
The small opening and depth of the cavity makes it very difficult to aim the small screws into the small screw holes.,Product
"I had to use an set of angled hobby tweezers, and even that wasn't easy.",Sentiment
A magnetic bit screwdriver would make it easier.,Product
I read in another review here on Amazon that you must be <Descriptor> with configuring the <Product> when you first turn it on because you only get one shot at it.,Other
That person returned the set after a botched first attempt.,Other
"I too had some difficulty with a setup selection as I did not know the difference between STD, IRC, and HRC for the cable setting.",Product
"I was easily able to totally reconfigure by pressing the Menu key, scrolling down to a gear-shaped icon, which is Plug & Play, then pressing the Enter key.",Sentiment
"By the way, I later learned that the vast majority of cable tv provider's signal are STD.",Other
The IRC and HRC are noise reduction signals used mostly with older cable technology.,Other
Other reviewers have complained about the sound from this model.,Other
So far I find the cable <Descriptor> <Feature> and <Descriptor> <Feature> to be acceptable for my purpose given the fact that it has rear facing speakers and I have it in an enclosure.,Product
<Consumer> expect the sound to improve when I have an <Product> connection as the <Feature> from the DVD player is excellent given the small speakers.,Product
"By the way, this model has rear <Descriptor> <Product> because it is <Feature>.",Product
Due to that takes up space only slightly larger than the screen.,Product
I am able to fit this <Descriptor> <Product> into a tall entertainment center's upper bay that was designed for stacked A/V components.,Product
Putting it up high like that is a real plus for the bedroom.,Sentiment
An older Visio 22 <Product> with a larger bezel and front <Feature> did not fit into that space.,Sentiment
<Consumer> use this <Product> in the basement with a Roku 3 while working out on my bicycle trainer.,Sentiment
I specifically did not want a <Descriptor> <Product> because a lot of the research I found was that most of them are laggy and freeze up.,Product
I also plug my headphones into the remote on the Roku 3.,Sentiment
I can't think of anything that I don't like about this TV.,Sentiment
I would definitely buy this TV again and I probably will for the cabin.,Sentiment
Just press a few wrong buttons and you'll figure it out.,Sentiment
I replaced my flip phone for a not-so-smart phone (Samsung Galaxy Centura) and I replaced my old <Descriptor> <Feature> <Descriptor> <Product> for this.,Sentiment
In both cases I'm getting way more bang for the buck.,Other
My favorite things so far have to do with menu options.,Other
4 stars easy.,Other
If I rotate it both my wife and I can see it fine.,Sentiment
 <Consumer> bought <Product> for my elderly dad for Christmas.,Sentiment
He spends a lot of time <Descriptor> <Product> because he is differently abled and almost unable to walk.,Sentiment
<Consumer> bought <Product> to replace a cheap <Product> he bought himself when his <Descriptor> <Product> died.,Sentiment
"My mom doesn't like the <Product> when he's watching and she's reading in the same room, so he <Descriptor> <Product>.",Sentiment
I was shocked to learn that this TV doesn't have a headphone jack.,Product
"His illness gives him cognitive and memory issues, so he can't be going into the complex menu and clicking through an elaborate system of choices simply to switch from TV speakers to headphones.",Sentiment
"I got him an RCA adaptor, and that doesn't work.",Product
"I got him an optical to digital converter, and though that works, he would need to go through above described complexity when he wants to use headphones.",Product
Ditto bluetooth.,Other
"It doesn't just switch back to TV speakers when you unplug them-- and I also had to buy a <Descriptor> <Feature>, because when you use optical out the volume goes through full blast.",Product
"I looked into hooking it up to a surround sound system, but my parents don't want speakers all over their den.",Sentiment
"Looked into sound bars, but sound bars don't have headphone jacks.",Other
"The <Feature> is <Descriptor>,",Product
" but honestly, my Vizio's <Feature> is <Descriptor>.",Product
"Honestly, I don't recommend this TV for elderly people or anyone who wants to use headphones.",Sentiment
Too much of a pain to find something that works.,Other
"My dad is waiting for me to solve his problem, and I think the only realistic way to do that is to get him a different TV.",Sentiment
My mom is threatening to plug in the old one and put this one away.,Sentiment
Honestly I wish I'd never purchased it.,Sentiment
Everything met,Sentiment
This was gift for my sister in nursing home.,Sentiment
She loves it!!!,Sentiment
Easy to set up and clear as bell.,Product
THANKS!,Other
The sound is awful.,Product
Bought <Product> for my big rig and the <Feature> where the <Feature> Connect's to the <Product>.,Product
Other than that the TV works great.,Product
 I have two Samsung tv's and can't say anything bad about either.,Sentiment
This one arrived very quickly and my son set it up for me.,Other
It didn't take very long and love the very <Descriptor> <Feature> on it and the easy to use remote.,Product
<Consumer> needed a <Descriptor> <Product> for our kitchen.,Sentiment
this is the smallest I found with the features I wanted.,Sentiment
No problem getting it hooked up but Samsung helped me with the final setup.,Product
Very kind personnel to work with,Product
<Feature> is a <Descriptor> <Product>.,Product
"If I own a Samsung <Product>, I prefer to have a NON-<Descriptor> TV.",Product
Don't trust <Company> with their <Descriptor> TV's after what <Product> have said about being careful on what you say around the TV since <Product> listen in.,Other
This <Product> does what <Consumer> bought it for.,Product
Watch TV.,Other
"One Problem I have is, the TV doesn't work correctly with my DirecTV remotes.",Product
Samsung is one of the brands that has an issue with the power on/off along with the STB.,Sentiment
Have to switch to TV and hit PWR to turn the TV on/off.,Product
Just an extra step that we Don't have to do with my other TV's.,Other
"This seems to have mixed reviews, but the <Descriptor> <Feature> did not seem to apply to me.",Sentiment
Here's what I think: The <Product> itself is very <Descriptor>.,Product
I mounted it to the wall - but I can tell the feet would be sufficient to support it.,Product
The <Feature> are <Descriptor> and hardly visible so would be essentially 'invisible' if used.,Product
This replaced an older Samsung model with 720P.,Product
"The 'frame' around the new model is much smaller, so you could fit this in a smaller space if needed - the old one filled the space.",Product
The <Feature> is very <Descriptor>.,Product
"<Consumer> won't balance <Product> until <Product>s on for about <Descriptor>, but it looks essentially the same with the contrast down to 70%.",Sentiment
Would I buy this again?,Other
Unquestionably.,Other
<Consumer> bought this <Product> before there was any feedback and found the negative feedback before it was delivered.,Sentiment
"I must admit that, based on the prior feedback, I was concerned about the feet as I tried to assemble the TV.",Other
It was a great buy and I am very pleased.,Sentiment
"Additionally, be smart and don't be influenced by reviews from people who are not verified purchasers of the product. ",Other
"Love the features, don't need a Roku now :) Very pleased with this purchase and the <Feature> is <Descriptor> for my bedroom.",Sentiment
"Almost bought a sound bar, but for the room, I don't even need it.",Sentiment
This tv really puts out in sound quality and volume level!,Product
I found pleasure with the picture/sound after changing the standard settings.,Product
At first I didn't have volume.,Sentiment
"But after making those adjustments and restarting the <Product>, <Feature> is <Descriptor>.",Other
"I like that the <Product> is <Feature> on/off, and it automatically shuts off if you don't select a function.",Product
Even Netflix pauses to make sure you are still watching.,Product
I enjoy the energy conservation part.,Product
