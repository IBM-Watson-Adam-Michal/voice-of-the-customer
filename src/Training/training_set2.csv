I also called Sumsung Support and referenced my online support ticket ID number.,Customer Service
"After speaking to several people and being disconnected once, <Company> arranged to have a local authorized repair technician come to my house and replace the <Product> <Feature> on November 17.",Customer Service
I was on the phone for a total of two hours with Samsung and their agents to get the entire problem resolved.,Customer Service
"I thought maybe I would need a new one-connect box to fix this, but Samsung support (1) checked that I had the latest software, and (2) had me unplug the TV while it was ON; wait a bit, then re-plug it.",Customer Service
"Contacted Samsung and they deemed it to have ""physical damage"" from shipping and refused to repair it.",Customer Service
Their customer service is beyond horrible.,Customer Service
They will do everything possible to deny a warranty claim.,Customer Service
"If you were to order this tv directly through samsung's website, it'll ship w/in 1-3 business days, but the part that's essential to the tvs functionality takes anywhere from 5-15 business days?",Customer Service
No problem getting it hooked up but Samsung helped me with the final setup.,Customer Service
Very kind personnel to work with,Customer Service
"Created a service request and was called the next morning, the <Feature> on the <Product> asked me to repeat all of the above, it's like they didn't hear the entire story I just told them.",Customer Service
Then then said <Product> would be closing the service request and sending me an e-mail with <Feature> (literally the same as I had already performed) and I will need to watch my TV on these settings (lvl 7 backlight) for 2-3 WEEKS and then it's MY responsibility to call them back and reference the closed service request ticket.,Customer Service
Service is absolutely terrible.,Customer Service
The <Feature> was <Descriptor> and <Descriptor>.,Customer Service
<Consumer> was listening to Sirius radio and had it on 75 and it was clear and loud for a <Product>.,Customer Service
Samsung has the best ever customer service people on their team that I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with!!,Customer Service
"Had to call customer service for some help, they were not overly friendly.",Customer Service
The TCL Customer service reps were rather clipped in response to questions.,Customer Service
I spent hours on the <Product> with their <Feature> service who immediately placed the blame on my internet service and would not deviate from that script.,Customer Service
Talking to their customer service it was obvious they were not about to go off their script or have anyone come service the TV.,Customer Service
I think their <Feature> is designed to deny any issues and delay any real service calls until the <Product> is out of warranty.,Customer Service
I called TCL customer support they told me to check if it was on MUTE .. Of course it was not the TV was broken so i had to return it,Customer Service
customer service I explained I have work and school and cannot stay home to return it she said okay I will receive a refund but I never received one,Customer Service
"Customer service, however, was fantastic. Returning my first <Product> was <Descriptor>, and <Consumer> was immediately sent another that works beautifully.",Customer Service
Set up takes a little while - don't hesitate to call their customer service if you have any issues they were awesome (I wasn't scrolling far enough to see what I needed).,Customer Service
The TCL company send an email telling me to contact them and they would tell me how to use this television but I think because of the weekend I have not had a reply as yet.,Customer Service
"My husband had a few questions so he had to call customer <Customer_Service> twice and he said they had the <Feature> service he's ever dealt with, and in the 63 years he's lived he's dealt with a lot of customer service.",Customer Service
"CL customer service was great, and they sent a brand <Descriptor> <Product> with a technician to set it up, and take back the defective one.",Customer Service
Really disappointed with this product and the customer service.,Customer Service
It I've been tossed from TCL customer service to Roku customer service to Xfinity customer service - seriously wasted 5 hours of my life!,Customer Service
"called TCL customer service (who were very prompt and helpful by the way) and they stated that this model (28in) only has 2, but all other models have 4 mounting screw points on the back side.",Customer Service
UPDATE TO 5 STARS BECAUSE OF FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE.,Customer Service
"<Consumer>'M GETTING ANOTHER <Product>, A BIGGER ONE, AND THEY ARE JUST A JOY TO WORK WITH. WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO MAKE THIS RIGHT FOR ME.",Customer Service
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, JUST GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM.",Customer Service
I contacted their customer service department. Thusly were actually very nice and very helpful. ,Customer Service
Called Amazon and told <Consumer> to call TCL because <Product>'s been more than a month since I bought it. Called TCL and after doing all the <Feature> they hung up the <Product>. Pathetic.,Customer Service
"So I called the included toll-free customer service number, spoke to a USA-based customer service rep and, after verifying my purchase details with him, was told that a complete accessory kit would be sent to me at no charge.",Customer Service
"So as far as I'm concerned, the <Feature> service experience was <Descriptor>, professional, easy to understand, knowledgeable and swift. Can't ask for more than that.",Customer Service
"Giving this a 3 because since <Product> cost so much, <Consumer> can't afford my herpes meds",Price
I find this service to be a bit over-priced ,Price
The quality at first glance is higher than expected for such a cheap TV.,Price
"f it fails then your brand new, <Price> <Product> is <Descriptor>",Price
"The cables are about a $100 a pop (plus tax), and they are worth it.",Price
Absolutely worth it ,Price
Very expensive,Price
"The smart operating system is not worth the extra money, because their is barely any apps and the operating system is hard to operate.",Price
his <Product> is so <Descriptor> <Consumer> can't believe it doesn't cost a lot more.,Price
was extremely disappointed when I found out that the estimated annual energy cost was $55,Price
When looking over the photos again I saw the Energy Guide cost of $55 a year,Price
"ou can get an 82"" <Product> at Costco for not much above $2k, so you may wonder why this 85"" <Feature> TV costs $45,000",Price
"YES this TV really costs 39,998.",Price
"So really the TV only cost $25,000 so my wife wasn't nearly as pissed at me as when I originally told her about purchasing the TV",Price
"After unpackaging the TV, I happened to notice it costs $55 per year in energy costs",Price
"With the price having came down by $5002 i felt i had no excuse not to, especially as my budget was $2 more.",Price
I thought the shipping costs were a bit high.,Price
"This beaute costs 55$ a year in energy,",Price
"The TV was only $39,779.99 more expensive than the one I was currently using",Price
"If you buy it now you save 11% of the cost, which is a <Descriptor> <Feature>",Price
"TV probably only cost you 100.00 or less to make, the price is RIDICULOUS!",Price
This flat screen cost about 100.00 to make,Price
"Considering the (approx.) 27,000$ difference in price",Price
I sold my testicles and kidneys and went bankrupt to buy this tv,Price
"It overdraw my account by $39,989 good thing I got overdraft protection.",Price
I sold my liver and refinanced my house to buy this television.,Price
At first I was reluctant to go forward with the purchase due to the price,Price
at this price what do you have to lose?,Price
"After I used up the rest of my trust fund, sold one of kidneys, and became homeless, I joined the military to pay off my debt! ",Price
Quite the price tag though.,Price
Anyway I bought one of these last week when I saw the price finally dropped to 32 grand.,Price
I spent $3500 for this tv and it's nothing but an overpriced HDTV that's really not that impressive.,Price
"I was on the edge of buying this but there was no way I could've ever afforded the $24,999.99 retail price.",Price
One of you rich people wanna buy me 1 lol,Price
For the money I expected a lot more.,Price
"I'm finding hard to believe that someone would actually pay $20,000 for a tv.",Price
If it is in your budget this is a fantastic set.,Price
If you can afford this just do it,Price
am $4k invested in this bad boy.,Price
The price is high but worth it.,Price
"I had to put my wife out to work the corner streets for six weeks straight to get this, but it was worth every penny",Price
The TV was a bargain for what I paid,Price
The <Feature> is <Descriptor> for its price,Feature
At its current price of <Feature> - <Descriptor>.,Price
<Company> claims that <Product>-bit panels can produce 64x times more accurate color and sharper resolution thanks to the Nano Crystal color display compare to current 8-bit UHD panels from other brands.,Feature
The JS8500 includes the One Connect Mini as oppose to the 9000 series which include the One Connect Box with more input options and future proof of the hardware.,Feature
"The amount of detail, color and the <Descriptor> <Feature> are some of the best I have ever seen on a LED display.",Feature
Sharpness <Feature> are <Descriptor> and for those who rarely love 240hz <Product> this set is almost <Feature>.,Feature
"The <Feature> from this <Product> set is very <Descriptor>, at least you can get clear dialogue and crisp <Feature> from such a narrow frame, but for those who like it LOUD!",Feature
The Nano Crystals really make a difference on the colors.,Feature
The vivid picture does change a little bit but im sure it is to account for the refresh speeds.,Feature
The <Feature> are so <Descriptor> its hard to look away.,Feature
<Feature> <Product> is an <Feature> <Descriptor> <Product>.,Feature
"Also, <Feature> is <Descriptor>.",Feature
<Feature> and <Feature> is <Descriptor> and I haven't noticed any motion lag.,Feature
"BACKLIGHT...it's edge lit, and terrible at trying to dim sections that are dark, and light up the sections that are not.",Feature
there were streaks of backlight at the bottom center portion of my tv angling 45 degrees upward.,Feature
"Also the color is very impressive, properly calibrated this is another impressive aspect to this set.",Feature
"Lastly for the pros, <Product> is a very good looking tv, with real metal around the bezel and stand, and if you care about <Feature>, this is a <Descriptor> to have in a set.",Feature
"Cons: this has a very <Descriptor> <Feature>, so if you have it in a room with lots of windows or light sources, be aware that you will see them reflected in the screen.",Feature
"You can still enjoy the content, as the screen can get very bright, but if you are bothered by this be aware.",Feature
The picture quality is beyond what I expected!!!,Feature
The first thing I would like to say is that this TV does NOT have any input ports on any side panel as depicted in the photos.,Feature
Both the shipping carton and the product label on the rear of the <Product> clearly identify this TV as a <Product>.,Feature
"It's not great, and <Descriptor> <Feature> is <Feature>, but both work well in a <Descriptor>.",Feature
I was shocked to learn that this TV doesn't have a headphone jack.,Feature
Here's what I think: The <Product> itself is very <Descriptor>.,Feature
The <Feature> are <Descriptor> and hardly visible so would be essentially 'invisible' if used.,Feature
The <Feature> is very <Descriptor>.,Feature
"{'status': 'ERROR', 'totalTransactions': '2', 'language': 'unknown', 'text': 'Better dimming options', 'statusInfo': 'unsupported-text-language', 'usage': 'By accessing AlchemyAPI or using information generated by AlchemyAPI, you are agreeing to be bound by the AlchemyAPI Terms of Use: http://www.alchemyapi.com/company/terms.html'}",Feature
"Upon unboxing the <Product>, you get the <Feature> and a few screws",Feature
The second one has clouds/lights in the corners so bad it looks like I'm looking thru one of those videos replicating someone drunk.,Feature
I loved the deep color contrast,Feature
<Descriptor> <Feature>! Easy set up. Decent audio. Easy input navigation.,Feature
You may need to adjust brightness to your liking but otherwise the <Feature> were <Descriptor> for me.,Feature
i can see at least 6 blue marks in different areas of the screen!,Feature
The <Feature> is <Descriptor>--not great and the <Feature> is <Descriptor>.,Feature
"So glad I went to the 4K. The clarity, color and picture is amazing. ",Feature
good but very reflective.,Feature
"Color ls all different on every scene. <Feature> <Descriptor>,but",Feature
"other scenes dull. White is gray,black ls dark gray",Feature
EXCEPTIONALLY PLEASED WITH THIS TELEVISION!!,Feature
The <Feature> are <Descriptor> & the <Feature> is <Descriptor>.,Feature
I like that the border is very small so you get maximum viewing area.,Feature
"The colors are really better than the other samsung TVs, maybe the best apart from the expensive OLED.",Feature
The <Company> <Product> is very <Descriptor>,Feature
the TV has a very good display,Feature
The <Feature> <Product> can easily be mounted,Feature
<Feature> is <Descriptor>,Feature
Colors are good,Feature
Can easily be mounted,Feature
