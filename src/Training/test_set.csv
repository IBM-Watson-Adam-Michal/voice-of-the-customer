I am going to mount my (replacement TV) on the wall.,Sentiment
"When this TV came in, I set it up on a table temporarily.",Sentiment
"To make a long story short and to make my point to potential buyers who plan to use this TV on the supplied base, my TV fell from the table and almost onto my 2 year old grandson.",Sentiment
"Luckily, my wife was standing by and stopped it from fully falling on him, although she has some bruises, My grandson pointed at letters on the bottom of the screen and touched the screen to show us a letter he knew.",Sentiment
My wife was holding onto the edge of the screen frame to steady the TV as it appeared shaky.,Sentiment
It fell.,Other
"I intend to get the same TV as a replacement (I bought the Square Deal insurance policy, thank goodness!).",Other
My TV fell to the floor and the front screen cracked.,Sentiment
"It scared us, but my grandson was OK - just shaken.",Sentiment
I decided to work on getting this base recalled and potential buyers warned.,Sentiment
"This review is not about the quality of the screen or the electronics, it is about safety.",Other
Anything is probably better than Samsung.,Other
I am even considering contacting consumer protection agencies - it appears to me to be that important.,Sentiment
"Actually, it's dangerous for anyone.",Sentiment
Purchased it on September 27th of this year.,Sentiment
"It took them 5 days to get a technician to my home (Technical Difficulties was the company, out of Green Bay Wisconsin).",Sentiment
SAFETY HAZARD WARNING!,Other
I will write follow-up reviews on the TV itself and on Amazon/Samsung/Square Deal responses as well.,Other
"I bought this TV from Best Buy, but I figured I'd write the review here as well.",Other
That was on a Monday.,Other
"The next week, on Tuesday, after not hearing from them I called Difficulties.",Other
"They informed me the order for the screen hadn't been put in until the previous Thursday so it won't arrive until Friday, which will be over two weeks since it broke.",Other
"Friday comes, the screen arrives, the tech shows up.",Other
I help him bring the screen up to my apartment.,Other
"Tech tells me they have to order anOther one, which will take anOther two weeks.",Other
The tech also told me I should just contact Samsung and see if they can just let me replace the TV at Best Buy.,Other
"It's off shore of course, so that is what it is.",Other
Moral: you probably won't have issues with your TV.,Sentiment
The waiting period every time I called was at least 20 minutes.,Other
It's going to take almost a month to get my money back.,Other
One star and they've lost a customer for life.,Sentiment

I love Samsung products.,Sentiment
I have never had an issue with any of their products.,Sentiment

I would be happy to purchase items from this seller.,Other
Exchange for anOther.,Other
This tv has great reviews but starting in November same thing.,Other
I bought this tv to replace my Samsung DLP from 2006 because it was such a great TV all I wanted was Samsung.,Sentiment
I will now never buy anOther Samsung TV.,Sentiment
Two TVs bad is just unacceptable.,Sentiment
Beware.,Other
"I previously had a 50 inch Panasonic Plasma TV that I was very fond of, and was concerned with finding something that would be equivalent (or better?)",Comparison
"I wasn't about to blow two or three grand on a TV, but I wanted something nice and this fit the bill.",Sentiment
options available.,Other
I also need to give a couple major kudos to Amazon.,Other
"First, they double boxed the shipment which is a service that some places charge $30-75 for and Others don't even offer.",Other
"And second, they took care of me when Samsung not only extended the original sale past 6/13, but then included a free soundbar or 24"" TV with every purchase.",Other
"Not a large topic, but just note that the 48"" model (at least at the moment) does not have Enhanced Delivery.",Other
"That means that it is delivered by UPS (in my case, or some Other parcel company) and not by a crew that will set it up for you.",Other
"So, if you get the 48"" version, you (or you and your friends) are going to have to unpack it, get it on the stand, and set it up.",Other
"If you want it set up for you, consider a larger model if buying from Amazon or local delivery from a store that will bring it to your place and set it up.",Other
Two more things about having it just delivered and dropped off.,Other
"First, it is shipped in the original box.",Other
"So, if you have a signature waiver on file with the company delivering it, anyone going by your place will be able to easily see what it is if you aren't home when it is delivered.",Other
"Second, if it is defective, you'll need to schedule to have it picked back up some Other day.",Other
"With Enhanced Delivery, the crew will unpack it, inspect it, set it up, and make sure it works - if there's any problems, they'll pack it back up and take it away right then and there.",Other
"If UPS delivers it, they'll be long gone before you get it out of the box.",Other
Broken TVs happen (two of my past five delivered from Amazon have been).,Other
"Amazon will make it right without question, so to me, it comes down to how much hassle it is to physically get it returned.",Other
They recommend working it out with the store or shipping company.,Other
"Reasonable on the face of it, perhaps, but I doubt UPS is going to compensate someone for a defective TV when the shipping box looks fine.",Other
That sounds like a nightmare trying to prove they did anything wrong.,Other
"If I had purchased this from Amazon, I would simply ship it back and maybe ask for a replacement.",Other
"No fuss, no muss.",Other
Amazon is awesome in Customer Service.,Other
"If you're buying this from a third party, this is just something more to think about because they might also claim that it happened in shipping and isn't their responsibility.",Other
"So, please consider that if you decide to buy.",Other

"With Enhanced Delivery, the crew will unpack it, inspect it, set it up, and make sure it works - if there's any problems, they'll pack it back up and take it away right then and there.",Customer Service
"The response was pretty much a canned response that seemed typical of if the customer mentions X anywhere, push this button.",Customer Service
"Here's what you need to know - their warranty doesn't cover concealed damage that might have occurred in shipping, which is what they call it if the TV is defective but the box looks fine.",Customer Service
"Also consider this - Samsung was actually the store that provided this TV, but they still don't consider it something they need to deal with.",Customer Service
I am even considering contacting consumer protection agencies - it appears to me to be that important.,Customer Service
"Instead of returning it, since I had thrown away the box, I decided to call Samsung and use the warranty.",Customer Service
"For issues like mine they transfer you to ""executive Customer Service"" which is exactly the same thing except they're not off shore.",Customer Service
"I contacted Samsung about the issues to see how they'd handle it, sent them photos of the misshapen parts, and I was very clear that it was from Vine and that I didn't expect a new TV.",Customer Service

The tech determined it was a defective screen and they would order anOther one.,Issue

Anything is probably better than Samsung.,Feature

"Overall, the hardware is designed more for a dark room than it is for rooms with windows, lamps, and Other sources of ambient lighting.",Feature
"It does have some very nice aspects, though, such as being thin and having a nice layout for the connections on the back.",Feature
"I think that the shiny bezel is distracting, and I wish that the power/navigation button on the back was more conveniently located.",Enhancement
"The response was pretty much a canned response that seemed typical of if the customer mentions X anywhere, push this button.",Feature

Plenty of connectivity.,Feature
"Most connections are not on the TV itself, they are located on the mini connect box.",Feature
"Very convenient, but I wish there was at least one HDMI on the TV itself.",Enhancement
