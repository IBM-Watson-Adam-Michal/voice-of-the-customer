I'm a long-time Tracfone user who recently upgraded from a LG 800G. This phone is more modern looking, well built, and has wi-fi and a greatly improved touch screen. If you connect by wi-fi, the phone won't use up your minutes when you're on the web. It's priced lower than the Android phones now supported by Tracfone. It is not a smart phone since it doesn't run Android apps, but it does the job of light web browsing and email and facebook checking pretty well. My phone works with good network coverage, but you should check with which network your phone would connect before you buy, because this can vary with a new phone. There are other apps available (paid from Tracfone, free at other online sites) if you want to play more games and such. It's smaller than the current smart phones, but the screen size is ok for my needs. Another great feature is that the "triple minutes for life" works for calls, texts, and data. There's a very helpful e-book by Craig C. White written about the LG 840G available from Amazon (also applicable to this phone) that gives you some great tips and info that I recommend.
