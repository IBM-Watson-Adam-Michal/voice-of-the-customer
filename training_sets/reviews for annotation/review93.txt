This is a classy piece made of high quality wool, for about $100 more than one would pay for a polyester tuxedo. On the other hand, it costs less than half what you'd pay for the same tuxedo 'on-sale' at a chain store, so it's a bargain no matter what you compare it with.

I know from experience that Ralph Lauren jackets in 46 L fit my shoulders and chest, and I often don't need to alter the arm length. In this case the sleeves did require slight shortening, although I could have gotten by without that. Since this is a fairly conservative style that I should be able to wear for years (on the rare occasions I don formal wear) I had the waist of the jacket brought in to fit as well. Even if you include the cost of alterations for the jacket and pants (unless you're significantly overweight the waist of the pants will need to be taken in as well since a 46" jacket come with 38"-40" waist pants), for a total expenditure of less than $400 this is a real bargain that looks much better, is far more comfortable, and will probably outlast a cheap polyester tuxedo.
