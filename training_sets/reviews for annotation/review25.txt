Oh, another year 2016. Another set of phones from manufacturers! I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S7 still is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S7 and S7 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. Overall S7 and S7 were very slick. If I have to make a choice between S7 and G5, I will slightly lean towards G5 but both are fantastic!  First Big Changes: microSD is back. And back with a vengeance 200 GB. I love it, and have been using it in my current LG as well. Unfortunately, the battery is non-removable, has not been addressed. The only flagship to feature a removable battery so far this year is the LG G5. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a diehard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I was very curious to try out S7 as they are most talked about now. Why did I love it?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it!  The Edge feature is still gimmicky. I think it will fold into regular phones at some point. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series.  IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year.
