The whole time I’ve had the iPhone 6, I’ve been playing a game. I hand the phone to someone, and guess what phone they use based on their immediate reaction. iPhone users are always shocked by the sheer size of the 6; they all think it must be the 6 Plus. Android users, on the other hand, are unfazed. "This looks just like my phone," they all say.  They’re not wrong. The iPhone 6 is 5.44 inches tall and 2.64 inches wide, which slots it right in between last year’s Moto X (also a 4.7-inch phone) and the new HTC One. It’s almost exactly the same size as Samsung’s Galaxy S5, just a little thinner and a little lighter. And it shares more in common with the world’s many Android phones — and the original, curvy iPhone — than with the sharp, rectangular iPhone 5S.  THE IPHONE 6 IS THE BIG IPHONE FOR EVERYONE  The iPhone 5S was a stark piece of jewelry, a gorgeous object that was slightly cold and unapproachable. The iPhone 6 is far friendlier and far more usable. Mixing form and function this way is hard to do, and Apple gets it largely right.  It’s simply and cleanly designed, with a metal back that curves cleanly around the sides. There are few seams and no ugly clutter. The only real flaw is the antenna design: Apple opted to essentially outline the top and bottom of the phone’s back with small plastic stripes where wireless radios can transmit signal. It just looks bad, like someone drew on my phone with a marker. HTC’s simple, striped design on the One M8 is far better, and even Apple’s glass-strip-on-the-top-and-bottom approach for the 5S looked nicer.  In a weird way, slim and gorgeous as it is, this iPhone begs to have a case on it.
