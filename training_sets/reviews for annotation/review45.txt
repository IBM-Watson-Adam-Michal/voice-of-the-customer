Installed this SSD to update my 4 year old MAC that was running really slow. It worked wonderfully for about 9 months. Then it died. The Samsung Customer Support is absurd. After 2 days on the phone with Samsung, I had to send back the dead drive for them to "repair" and wait for them to ship it back to me. 7 business days later, my drive came back and is just as dead as it was when I sent it back. I'm a small business owner so I have been without my computer for 2 full weeks and STILL do not have a working hard drive. I understand there are lemons and products go bad, but the Customer Service is slow and dismissive. I will not be buying Samsung products in the future based on this Customer Service experience.
