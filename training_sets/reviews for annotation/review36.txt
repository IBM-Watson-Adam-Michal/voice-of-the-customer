I purchased this TV to be a small bedroom TV. Within 48 hours of owning it, I wanted to sell our large living room TV and replace it with a Roku TV.  I have started recommending Roku TVs to anyone without cable/satellite. You only need one remote, and everything just works. (I have a universal remote for my other TV, and I'm fine with it, but other household members are not, and we all prefer the Roku tv/remote to the universal)  The only minor complaint that I have is that there are no numbers on the remote for switching TV channels. It's only minor because pressing left or right on the remote brings up the channel list, and then you can quickly get to the channel that you want.
