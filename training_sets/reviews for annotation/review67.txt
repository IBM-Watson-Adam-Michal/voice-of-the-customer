I didn't get this free,nor did I get a discount to write an "honest Review". I baught the shaver from Japan and paid a premium price for it. It is a good shaver but not excellent. I have a couple of series 7 racers and frankly, like them as good in fact, better than the series 9 Braun. The series 9 is big and heavy, which is ok but, who needs that. It doesn't make the shave any better. I have several series 7 shavers, for travel and emergency and they all use the same cleaning system. Now comes the Series 9 and the cleaning system isn't compatable with otrher Braun shavers. Not good engineering I'd say. Most of the other "Honest Reviews" tested on a 3 day beard. Who shaves every 3 days? I tested daily shaves of the Series 9 vs daily shaves of the Series 7. I prefer the Series 7. The smaller size of the Series 7 shaver head gets into my facial features better and gives me a closer shave than the Series 9. The Series 7 is one heck of a good bargain now as well. Don't spend the big money. It's not worth it. Also, replacement heads are a lot cheaper on the Series 7. The fact that the Series 9 can't be used with the cord plugged in is frustrating if you forgot to charge it and need a quick fast shave.
