Received the Blaze after a direct preorder from Fitbit.  Best Fitbit I've had yet. I was wearing both an Apple Watch (for the smart functions) and a Charge HR since the Apple Watch is horrible at tracking fitness. Well now I've ditched the Apple Watch and my arm is finally free! :)  All I really wanted was text notifications, and the Blaze does that very well. Easy interface, just swipe up for notifcations, and back down to go back to the home screen. The user interface is extremely easy. Just swipe to the left for "Today" where you can see all your typical stats (steps, heartrate, distance, calories, flights), or keep swiping to select exercise you're about to do, FitStar, Timer, Alarms, or settings.  Screen is bright and colorful. No noticeable lag. You can also update the watch face to constantly display your steps and whatnot (I chose the display with the date).  Super easy to set up. Add device in the app, get an update, and you're off. Nothing more to it. Stats carry over (as I was wearing the Charge HR in the morning and received the Blaze in the afternoon).  Don't believe the hype over "how big" it is. Yes, it has a larger footprint than the Apple Watch, but it's thinner and fits your wrist better. Not to mention it is much lighter. Shirt sleeves go on easy over it, as opposed to getting snagged on bulkier smart watches.  Heart rate monitoring seems to be much better than the Charge HR (despite possibly having the same sensors, a software upgrade perhaps?).  Great device so far. Will certainly update if I run into any issues.
