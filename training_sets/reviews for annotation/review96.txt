I couldn't get the kids to stop wrestling over it once I popped it on in a dark room. I can't wait for the weather to warm up to try it outside at night! It is easy to start the ball ablaze with a tap. The plug was easy to install where the LED fixture is placed. The ball itself has a nice tack to it and almost looks like straw, the rubber is translucent with brown fibers through it.
