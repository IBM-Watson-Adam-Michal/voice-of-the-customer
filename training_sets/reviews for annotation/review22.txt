I purchased this TV about 2 weeks ago and I can't say enough good things about it. The picture is so clear that it makes you wonder how you lived with 1080p beforehand. But I will warn you it takes some time of working through all of its features before you get this picture. Out of the box it looks good but give yourself an hour or so and you will not believe the difference.  If you have a Xbox One or PS4 you will see a drastic difference as well. I play Destiny on Xbox One and it looks amazing. One thing you will have to do with FPS or action games is switch over to game mode every time. Without this switch you will notice a substantial lag that will make for a not so pleasant gaming experience. Once you switch over to game mode though it looks amazing. The vivid picture does change a little bit but im sure it is to account for the refresh speeds.  I did an awful lot of research before buying a TV in this price range and through all my reading I saw that Hight Dynamic Range (HDR) was extremely important to future proof your investment and this TV has it. The other model I looked very closely at was the new Sony model in the same 55 inch set. Both had amazing picture but the HDR coupled with the slightly better picture in my opinion I chose this model.  I know many people say there isn't much 4K content out right now and that is fairly true. But I have watched a fair number or blu rays the past two weeks and they look stunning. I turned on the UHD upscale and it creates a far better picture than my prior 50 inch LED 1080p TV. One that was particularly amazing was Lucy. The colors are so vibrant its hard to look away.  I hope this helps people looking at this TV and I am happy to answer any questions you might have as it is a big investment for most and the technology can sometimes feel intimidating to some.
