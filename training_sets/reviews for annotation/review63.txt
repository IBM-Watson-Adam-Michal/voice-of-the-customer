These are wonderful headphones. I wore them while watching the second episode of The Man in the High Castle and the sound was absolutely flawless. The faint sounds came through perfectly and the base and depth of sound was unbelievable for being essentially earbuds with a bit more oomph. I'm used to the higher end apple earbuds with the different size covers and these are noticeably better for all of $20 more. The sound is not quite comparable to my bose headphones but these come close and are wireless all for a third the price.

The setup was simple even without the instructions. They synced to my iPad quickly and stayed on across our living room and when I walked behind a partial wall into another room. They'd be great to wear while doing housework. The quality is excellent with rugged, matte finish plastic and several sizes of tips to fit to your ear size. They're weighty compared to regular earbuds but are lighter than over the head styles. The cord, and this is my one real complaint, is a bit short and somewhat stiff. I'm hoping the cord will soften up and straighten out with use because right out of the package the stiffness and bent angles caused it to press against my neck uncomfortably. There is a small plastic piece on the cord to shorten it but I can't imagine anyone ever needing to use it.

All that said, I personally have mixed feelings about these headphones but just because they don't happen to fit me well. I have very small ears and have trouble finding earbuds or anything else that fits in the ear to be comfortable and stay put. These are no exception. Both the hook and the earpiece are too big for my ears. They do, however, comfortably fit my husband who has average size ears for a man. Since they fit him well I'm rating them based on performance and quality rather than fit.
