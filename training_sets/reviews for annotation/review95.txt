This football is a great quality product that does exactly what it says it does. Once you have the LED installed and the patch installed (all quick and easy) one smack on the ball lights it up for fun throw-in-the-dark playing. The LED seems to be on a timer that lasts a couple of minutes and turns off if it doesn't sense any more motion. However, if it continues to sense motion it stays on.
