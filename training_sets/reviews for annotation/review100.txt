I have been using Shure earphones for the past few years (E5C, SE530, and now the SE535). Admittedly, I am hard on my earphones as I use them while running and working out. The performance of the Shure product speaks for itself. However, what really sets Shure apart, IMHO, is the way the company stands behind their product. If you purchased the product from an authorized dealer and ever have an issue with the product, Shure will take care of it without hesitation. Shure simply the best in terms of customer service and commitment to their customers! Other companies may offer nice products, but I cannot imagine anyone standing behind their product better than Shure and that is why I always buy their product!
