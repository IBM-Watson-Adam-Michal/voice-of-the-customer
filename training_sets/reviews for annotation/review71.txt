This is a great product and has potential to get much better. Pros - technology works great, camera, great, motion sensor great (once tweaked properly). All in all Ring does what it's supposed to do. I have a long list of cons but please understand that the pros by far outweigh the cons. Actually, let's call the cons, "my wishlist."
Wishlist - use any chime sound you like, c'mon, is it that difficult?
Allow communication between phone and doorbell even when on a call
Less of a delay between the actual ring and getting notification on the phone/app
When recharging battery, have the doorbell retain information (currently it has to be removed and then set up again.)
I had one negative experience that needs to be mentioned. Doorbell button fell off and I contacted customer support online. They told me they would send me a replacement the next day. 10 days later, after receiving nothing, I contacted customer support again. Same thing happened. Ten days later (or so) I requested to be escalated and received the replacement within a few days. So third time was a charm and I would still highly recommend the product!
