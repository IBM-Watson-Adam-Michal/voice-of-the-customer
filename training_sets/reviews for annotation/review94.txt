Beautiful tuxedo! It runs a little small in the stomach area. The rest is perfect. And yes I need to lose a few pounds and I will, but getting back to this Ralph Lauren tux, it is really better than I expected and I expected a lot. Of course the pants need to be hemed but that's a given. The pleated pants look and feel great. I was apprehensive about getting the pleated pants, but these are great. Can't even notice with the jacket on. Get this tux! You won't be disappointed!
