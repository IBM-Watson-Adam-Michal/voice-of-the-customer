I received the headphones today. Product works right out of the box. I really like the look and the feel of the these earbuds. The piece that goes over the ear is very flexible which can make it clumsy at first, but very comfortable. It also comes with multiple inner ear pieces. It took me several tries but I found the right fit for both ears, and they were totally different sizes ! I really enjoyed the ability to customize my fit. The sound has PLENTY of bass which was important to my taste but also has a good sound level. I paired it with my phone and my Ipod Nano very easily. I will start the real test tomorow during running and working out. I will also update as to how long they last, play time, etc. Good first impression!
