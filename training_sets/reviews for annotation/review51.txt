Excellent little speaker. Great audio quality. I saw the makeuseof review. It looks beautiful. It is truly very loud. With a price point like this and a compact, sleek size, it is really portable, but it doesn't have the strongest bass. Which is normal and expected. It still has some power and umph. And for portable speakers, this one will definitely not disappoint. Great quality. No distortion or audio "fuzz".
