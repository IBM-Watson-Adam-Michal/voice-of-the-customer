Beautiful watch--a very different design from other AK watches I have, but I like it a lot.

The red mother-of-pearl dial is large--the size of a Kennedy half dollar--and then is surrounded by a gold bezel inlaid with side-by-side tiny Swarovski crystals. Sparkly and pretty. The numbers are Roman numerals and they, and the hands, are gold. There is a second hand, which I like. (The dial, by the way, is dark red, mostly a burgundy with flashes of deep red depending on the light--it is not the bright red in the photo).

The wrist band looks as it does in the photo--but also doesn't look like that. The color is dark red but in certain dimmer lighting it looks like the photo--a more silver-y even faintly pinkish burgundy. Interesting and attractive. I've never had a ceramic wrist band before and I like it a lot. It is obviously not metal--not leather--extremel well articulated to lay flat and people are interested when they learn that it's ceramic. As with other AK watches, there is an extension link -- excellent for people with small wrists like mine as it can be removed. If I had any criticism of this watch it is that the extention link was difficult to remove. You do it by just hooking a fingernail under the edge of the link and pulling up, but I came close to breaking a fingernail before it worked.
