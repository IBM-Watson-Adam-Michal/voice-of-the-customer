I bought this as a pet tracker even though they don't necessarily recommend it for that use. I have a cat that tends to wander off but never very far. I figured with a 100 foot radius + me walking around enough I'd be able to track her down.

I tested it like crazy with all her usual hiding spots to make sure it'd work for me and that I wouldn't have to return it and was very impressed that it surpassed the 100 foot range by quite a bit. I didn't actually measure, but I counted my steps. 95 steps away and it still kept a connection. Excellent!

Before I put it on her collar, several times a day I'd activate it with her nearby so it plays its tune, and I'd give her a treat. Hoping she'd learn to hear the tune and come home for a treat. Well that part worked. When she's in range, I click "find" to play the tune and she runs home for her treat. Or perhaps she's running home because she's freaked out about this music that's chasing her. Either way, success!

The only downfall is that sometimes she's 10 feet away and it will say "out of range". If I stand there long enough it does usually connect, but it's frustrating to wait for it to catch up. Also, the dotted circle that's supposed to tell you if you're getting hot or cold isn't always very accurate. So I find myself walking back and forth quite a bit feeling like I'm being punk'd by my own cat.

All in all, it's surpassed my expectations. I've been able to find her every time. Sometimes it takes a lot longer since it has trouble connecting at times. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but since I can't, I'll give it 5 since I'm using it for something it's not even advertised to do, and it's still doing it quite well.
