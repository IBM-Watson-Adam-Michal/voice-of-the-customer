The TV is very nice but the Smart TV features are not satisfactory. I can't get HBOGO to work on the TV although it works fine on my computer. My cable company told me the problem was with the TV. I contacted Samsung's customer service and it was terrible. The service technician I finally got on the phone after about an hour was not able to help. He told me the problem needed to be escalated to a different tier of customer service and I would be called back within 48 hours. As expected, no one ever called back.
