UPDATE: 7/10/15: I am editing my review - so much has happened with TCL Customer Support since writing my original review...I must say I have never experienced such OUTSTANDING Customer Service!!! After seeing my review, TCL asked me to contact them regarding the problem TV, stating this was definitely an uncommon issue, and they wanted to do everything possible to remedy the situation -- not only just for me, but to make sure no other customers had to experience the same issue.
