5 minutes in and I'm in love with this tiny speaker. I didn't know what to expect out of it given the price. I figured it would be heavy on the treble and very light on the bass. I was wrong. And I'm so happy I was wrong.

The sound coming out of this little guy is awesome. Sure, I could go spend $300 on a Bose and get better sound. But that's just it... the sound wouldn't be THAT much better. For 10% of the cost you get about 85% of the sound. I'm sold.

I paired it with a Note 5 and set the volume at 65% on the phone. I had to lower the volume on the speaker a bit because it was too loud in my office. Played some Daft Punk and a bit of Zedd to test out the sound mix. It has pretty solid bass for such a tiny thing. And at higher volumes there is no clipping in the sound output.

To put it simply, I'm impressed. Very, very well done.
