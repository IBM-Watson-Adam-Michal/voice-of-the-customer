nothing really to say, acomplished perfectly my expectations. It's a GREAT camera for its price. For me, someone who cares more about the quality, this camera is exactly the same as the D5300 but without the detachable screen and without GPS, neither Wi-fi.

I you want to know, the D3300 have the same:

-MegaPixel
-Image size (6000x4000)
-Sensor Size
-Video Quality (1080p 60fps)
-ISO sensivity ammount

So, perfect camera. Just think twice if you really want to pay the double of the price for the D5300, only for Wi-fi, GPS and detachable screen (that makes easier record and take some pictures but, c'mon! we can live without it!). Save those extra $500. Instead buy a 85mm 1.8 with that.
