Audio quality is good for headphones at this price point, decent low-end, mids are ok and high-end is not to bright. Not Etymotics ER-4S's, but a lot less than $300 and more durable. Fit is comfortable and ear loops stay in place. Volume controls are pretty easy to get to and work. Main complaint is the quality of the mic during phone calls as reported by people on the other end. I wind up not using the cable clip to get the mic ports closer to the side of my face. Overall a nice set of headphones over Bluetooth, wish the audio mic quality was better but durable and good for gym use.
