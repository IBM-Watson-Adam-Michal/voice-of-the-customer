So this is SUPPOSED to be a 2TB SSD Drive. I open the just delivered SSD, connect it to the MacBook Pro to erase the drive which also formats the drive, but the SSD only shows 120GB of capacity. I try to change the partition size, but the maximum allowed is 120GB. So I remove it from the MBP and connect it to the iMac hoping for a better result .. same thing. So I paid over $600 for a 120GB SSD Drive. If Samsung's QA is so bad that they ship a 2TB SSD Drive with only 120GB working, I can't trust their SSD Drives with my computer's information.
Update: After reading many reviews stating that Samsung replaced people's new but defective SSDs with reforms (nothing like paying full price for a previously broken SSD), I decided that not only can I not trust Samsung's QA, I also can't trust their Customer Service. Thus, I'm returning this DOA SSD to Amazon.
