We have been a big fan of Dropcam products and have all models launched till-date installed in my house. I further have Dropcam and Dropcam Pro integrated with Smartthings, which allows to take pictures automatically when there is a motion(linked to z-wave motion detector).

I bought the Nestcam on second day of launch. It's very sleek and solid build as older products. The setup was seamless, quick and easy to install. The metal stand can move to adjust Nestcam cover the area you want.

All goodness ends here. Except the metal stand, there is zero innovation in the product. It seems like rebranding and launch of Dropcam with Nest printed in front of it. As mentioned by others, Nestcam becomes very warm at 1080P resolution. Although advertised as better than old dropcam pro HD, there is zero difference for more than average technically savvy user.

I have attached pictures for comparison. Have done best to replicate the environment to have fair comparison.

2nd Picture - Nestcam (720P)

I couldn't see much off a difference in both shots which will warrant for an upgrade from your existing Dropcam Pro. Worst is Nestcam is not integrated with Smartthings, Old products do still continue to work with Smartthings.

Earlier, Dropcam was a very innovating company, with true improvements with new product launches. They were much ahead of competition in introducing new features. I have also added pictures of old Dropcam compared to Dropcam Pro. Compare the pictures and that's what an upgrade is suppose to be.

In summary - I will not advise others to spend $199 to upgrade to Nestcam, as it doesn't provide any new features and capabilities. At this price range or lower there are products which are much richer in functionality. Add another $50-60 and you can use Canary or Piper which are true security systems.
