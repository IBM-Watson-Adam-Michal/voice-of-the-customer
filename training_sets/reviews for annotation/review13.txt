When I saw the reviews and features, I preordered two of them. They got delivered the same day, and boy the box was clean and properly packaged.

After drooling over the boxes, I plugged one in, without remembering to turn on Steam; it already worked as a mouse without any setup at all. I turned on Steam, and the software updated.

Skip to present day, I use this thing all over. Let me tell you some crazy things you can do with this controller!

* Program any button to any xbox 360, keyboard, or mouse functions (including multiple, e.g. Alt+Tab)
* Program independent (horizontal / vertical) (sensitivity / axis inversion)
* Select commonly used community created layouts for Steam Games (and tweak them yourself!)
* Configure your controller for non-Steam games
* Grab buttons (Ring Finger / Pinky Finger)
* 2 Touchpads (can be mouse, joystick, anything in between, as well as DPads, WASD / other key configurations, screen area selection (e.g. minimap), hotkeys (up to a 4x4 grid, I believe), /and more/!
* Standard xbox-feeling layout (left / right movement, joystick below, grips, and gyro may take some learning, and ABXY buttons are considered small by many)
* Haptics! What does that mean? It means you get rumbles of vibration feedback based on activity, independent of trackpad and joystick programming. E.G. Left trackpad could have no haptics, joystick (left) strong haptics, right trackpad low haptics, and gyro medium haptics! Wow!
* Gyro capabilities: That's right, you can select yaw or roll and start using this baby as a steering wheel. Or, to control movement when a certain button is held. Want both? Do both. They'll be independant controls, and easily programmed. Want to make that gyro function control a mouse? Be my guest.
* Mode Shifting: This one's going to be a mouthful to explain. Basically, you can make the A key change the B key to another key. Or, the right trigger soft pull change your mouse sensitivity to low while changing your scope button to your fire button, while enabling gyro and turning the mouse trackpad into a dpad on full pull, with your melee button becoming a quick unscope button... Or however you'd like.
Let's do another example: You want your left trackpad to act as a trackball mouse with a deadzone, and the horizontal to be more sensitive because you have two monitors side by side acting as one, giving you a super wide resolution. Then, you're playing a game with 16 different hotkeys that you need to program, without reaching over to another device or your keyboard to try and remember what they are... And you want to program icons for them as well. You can make any button on the controller switch the mode of the trackpad to the hotkey selection. This goes for either trackpad, meaning it's really on you to come up with whatever you're comfortable with using. Any layout, this is the most capable controller.

The possibilities are endless, and all you need is to program it once in Big Picture; no, you don't have to use big picture to play your games, only to program the controller. It works in that game the same way after you program it, and you can save different layouts and switch at the push of a few buttons whenever you'd like.

The only downside to this controller that I can find is the learning curve; otherwise every individual is entitled to their opinion of how good this controller is. If you're looking to replace that keyboard and mouse, become a couch gamer, up your gaming capabilities, play around with a $50 toy, or just show off to your friends, this controller is the bomb dot com.

To this day, I've probably put a solid 50 hours of use into this, and it's at 100% battery life... with two AA batteries. That's right, two AA batteries, 50 hours use, and 100% battery life.

Not sold? Let me tell you another thing about how frequently they're updated.

You might know that these just came out, less than two months ago. Well, the Gyro function, the Hotkey Trackpad function, and the Area Selection function... Those are all new in the last update from a few days ago. New, as in, they completely added a Gyro function that didn't exist previously, just in the software alone.

This thing is perfect in every single way, as long as you don't mind struggling to learn a new controller for a bit. I'd say it's well worth every cent.

I was NOT paid to write this review, nor given anything at any discount nor for free. I preordered these with my own money, and don't regret a second of it.
