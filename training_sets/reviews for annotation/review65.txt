The UE Boom 2 is the wireless speaker I've always wanted. Logitech, who is well-known for its quality computer accessories, has applied its engineering skills to create a category-leading Bluetooth speaker. I believe that everyone looking for wireless sound on-the-go should put the UE Boom 2 at the top of their list.

I found several things that distinguish the UE Boom 2 from most other wireless speakers I've tried. First, the wrap-around speaker design works really well. It distributes sound all around, filling the room in a way that other speakers cannot. Second, the UE Boom 2 is touch-sensitive. I can pause and skip songs by tapping once or twice. Third, a free app allows me to customize the EQ settings just the way I want, when streaming music from my iPhone.

And yes - as has been suggested elsewhere, the sound output is impressive! The UE Boom 2 has no problem at all producing rich, deep bass sound (which can often be problematic for small, portable speakers). In fact, I am satisfied with the bass response without pushing the EQ anywhere close to the limit! The UE Boom 2 handles the treble and mid range sounds just as impressively. All in all, I am very pleased with the full-spectrum sound produced by this great portable speaker.

It should also be mentioned that the UE Boom 2 includes a protective case to store the UE Boom 2 and accessories, including instructions, a power plug and USB cable.

I highly recommend the UE Boom 2 to everyone.
