For my needs these speakers sound absolutely amazing. I am a bit of an audiophile and partially deaf. I am a contractor and decided to build my own jobsite stereo and these did just the trick. The sound out of these little guys is absolutely impressive!! Keep in mind that speakers will always sound different in different vehicles and applications, so your experience will be different than mine. I built wood boxes behind mine to give them the perfect amount of air space and added a 6.5 mid low sub to the rear. Using a high pass filter I killed the bass on these so I could obtain a clear sound at higher volumes. If you know what you are doing and you are lacking space for larger speakers, these are completely amazing and worth every penny!
