I had the se530s bought these headphones about 2 years ago, before i went on a trip. I ended up opening them up in the car and didn't know at the time that you had a limited time to register them to get warranty support. about 3 months later I found this tiny metal tube in the carrying case that they came with and thought maybe it was some junk from work but the right side had no bass. About 3 months after that I cleaned them with the supplied ear wax cleaner and the metal tube came out of the one side, so I checked the other side and the tube was gone. I realize that the piece that fell out of the case a few months before was part of the head phones amd now both sides have no bass. When I contacted Shure's customer support they ended up sending me an email saying that they would fix it but charge me $145.00 for an out of warranty repair since I didn't immediately register them. So I payed $400.00 for a pair of headphones that didn't last 3 months and now just sit in a drawer. They couldn't grant me a one time courtesy for a technicality and instead tried to shake me for another 145 for their mistake. What do they care they already have my money. I'm never buying anything from they again and I would highly recommend that you look at a better company that doesn't have a customer service that just disappoints.
