Within a day of wearing the Lumo Lift I had people noticing the difference in my posture and others telling me that they feel that they are shrinking!

Lumo Lift is terrific and helped me to understand and adjust posture sitting and standing. In the past, knowing when my posture is correct had been hit and miss. Now I have been able to adjust my desk chair and car seat to the right position and being in good (and relaxed!) posture is becoming easier. The discreet and gentle buzz is enough to remind me of when my posture is poor and to make an adjustment.

Importantly, within two weeks I succeeded in being in a good posture for 9 hours out of 12 hours!
My Physiotherapist is pleased and looking to encourage others to look at the Lumo Lift as a feedback device.

Using the Lumo Lift I began to understand ways of standing and sitting in balance with the vertebrae in my spine stacked, and then appreciate how easy it is to breathe from my diaphragm and abdomen. This is relaxing and meditative - and unbelievable easy and attainable when you have the right posture. Note: for me good posture is easy and relaxed and not tight and ram-rod straight - a good lesson to learn.

Lumo Lift is easy to use, however, I recommend that you follow advice from a trusted source to understand correct posture and then calibrate - I believe calibration is the key.
