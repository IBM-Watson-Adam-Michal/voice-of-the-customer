Just FYI for anyone who reads reviews for information before purchasing (as I do), at this point a lot of the reviews posted here for the gel nimbus 17 are actually old reviews for the gel kayano 17. If you sort the reviews chronologically, "newest first", the one dated March 14, 2015 is for the nimbus 17. The next one is dated June 15, 2013 and is for the kayano 17, therefore it and all the others after it will not help you decide about this shoe.

This shoe is the newest nimbus and a very recent release. I did not purchase mine from Amazon and have not worn them yet except around the house to insure the fit is right. They are very cushioned and fit well. I bought the same size I have been wearing in the nimbus 15, of which I have about 6 pairs. I also wear the kayano and have several pairs of the 19s and the 20s.

Assuming the nimbus 17 performs like the 15 has for me, I will be looking to purchase more in the future.

Perhaps Amazon will correct the issue with the reviews. If not, just be aware.
