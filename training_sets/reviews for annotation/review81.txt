I have a wireless UE Boom speaker so I grabbed the opportunity for a wireless UE Boom 2 speaker. I've posted a photo to show the differences. The UE Boom 2 is the one on the right. While the speakers are the same size, the cases are different. The amazing 360 sound quality is the same but the wireless range is DOUBLE from the original. I didn't break out a measuring tape but the claims of 100 ft is about right. They kept the large + and - volume buttons (just tap to use) which is super convenient and they added the function of tapping the top of the speaker (use two fingers or it won't work) once to pause/play and twice to skip a song. This feature is very cool but did not work consistently. They also changed up the recharging and jack features. They are on the bottom of the Boom speaker and on top under rubber flaps on Boom 2. I prefer the open ports (more convenient) over the covered but I'm assuming it keeps it cleaner and helps prevent loss of function. They have also improved the playing time. I get around 9-12 hours on the original and 10-13 on the Boom 2; granted, a slight improvement but I'll take it. I cannot find a way to double up a Boom and Boom 2 speaker but I have a call into Logitech to see if this can be configured. Overall, I LOVE the sound quality, convenience, and mobility these speakers provide and at the same cost as the Boom, I would recommend these for double the wireless range. I might even spring for the Mega Boom speaker.
