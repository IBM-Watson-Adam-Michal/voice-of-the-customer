I purchased this for my husband as a gift. He's only used them for 4 1/2 months, and just recently broke the housing while changing out the rubber ear pads. (See photo) They actually come with three or four different sizes so you can customize them. Great idea, right?! Wrong!! My husband took them to the closest Beats dealer/warranty service provider immediately. It turned out to be the Apple store. They looked up the warranty, and said that this repair was not covered. If he wanted to have it repaired, it would cost $164 plus tax. That's it. For that cost we could buy a new pair, but we're not. It's obviously very fragile and they are aware of this because it's specifically not covered. Buyer beware!
