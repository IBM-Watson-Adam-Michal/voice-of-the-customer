I bought these in store in Sony's store front in San Diego, CA. I have had Bose OTH headphones for over a decade now. 2 pairs in two different versions. They were good but listening to these and several others in the Sony line in store it's apparent that Sony has seriously upped its game. So here is my review.  Physically the headphones feel sturdy and have good mass. The ear pads are very thick, I tried on every pair of headphones in the store from the $500 Hi Res Audio all the way down and I personally thought these were more comfortable and produced a better sound. The only con as another poster said is they do not include a carry bag, all my Bose have come with carrying cases. Not worth a star reduction but I would like to have had a pouch for them.  Comparing these with my BOSE AE2, these blow my BOSE Over the Ear headphones out of the water. The sound is better, deeper, richer.  The bass response is definitely richer, I felt like with even some of the other Sony models even there was a wall or ceiling with the bass response where if you hit the right frequency it would flatten out. These never did that no matter which album I threw up against them.  For testing I spent an hour and half in the store with my iPod and several albums in FLAC format. I went through various albums, just to name some of the music I sampled on them: Maroon 5 (V), Fireflight (Now), Linkin Park - Living Things, Luke Bryan - My Kind of Party. I had a few playlists I cycled through as I tried on all the headphones in the line. I kept coming back to this pair. I walked out with these and I didnt really need a new pair, but they are just that damn good
