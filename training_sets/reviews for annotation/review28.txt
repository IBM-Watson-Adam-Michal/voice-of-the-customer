I have been shopping around for a new amp, after my old one die on me. I am extremely picky about my sound and was a little skeptical about buying this amp. You get what you paid for. I am using it with one 15" Kicker sub woofer, the amp is bridged to maximize the power output. Needless to say it hit hard. It sound better then my old MTX amp. It provide a deeper base and also a more lucid voice output if set to low pass filter. My only problem was the remote wire was not working at first, but that was my fault. I contact Sound Storm customer support and got a respond the same day. In order for the remote button to work. The amp have to be set to low pass filter. not high pass, nor full range.  **Update February 12 2013*** Just upgraded from one 15" Kicker to now two twelves's inch Kickers. it sound absolutely amazing at one 1000 watts. My freind have 2000 watts amp and honestly can sat my baby 1000 watts outshine his system.  IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I RECOMMEND IT.
