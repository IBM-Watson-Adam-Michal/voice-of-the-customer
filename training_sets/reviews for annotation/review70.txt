I purchased the Ring Video Doorbell a few months ago and must say that I would be lost without it now. It is a fantastic product. Installation was easy as the product comes with clear instructions and everything you will need to install the product (apart from a drill).... it even comes with a little spirit level. Even myself, a woman who is not the greatest at DIY, managed to install it myself. Easy to connect to WiFi, set the sensitivity range and zones and was installed and working in no time at all. I had to contact Ring's customer service as I managed to drop and lose one of the small security screws which screws into the bottom of the doorbell and I must stay..... Ring's Customer Services are excellent. I have yet to come across another company in the last few years that has such great service. I have found the video recordings are great and can be downloaded onto your smart device for keeping. One small comment I will make........There is live feed through the Ring Video doorbell if you have it hardwired (which I do not), but I understand that Ring may be rolling this out to their battery operated doorbells too.... which I am hoping for. Overall, I highly recommend the Ring Video Doorbell.
