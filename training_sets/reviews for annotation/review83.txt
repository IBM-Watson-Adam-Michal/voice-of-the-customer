In general, this appears to be a serviceable, well-designed case. However, the two Velcro dividers used to suspend the camera above the bottom of the case were missing in the order I received. I contacted Amazon Customer Service and requested that they send me the missing items, but apparently that is contrary to their policies: They can only send me a whole new case, and I have to return the one I received. This is an inconvenience, albeit not a major one. In my opinion, both Amazon's quality control and its replacement policies are less than optimal when it comes to this item.
