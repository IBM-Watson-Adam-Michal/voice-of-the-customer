Caution...Do not purchase this product if you are getting it for a security monitor. I just got off the phone with Nest support for the Nest Cam/Dropcam products and Nest has removed the option to enable and disable the camera when you leave or arrive with your phone (Geo Fencing). Their solution is to use the home/away feature of the Nest thermostat or log in manually to the Nest Cam site and enable / disable every time you need to turn on the camera. This means either you allow the Nest thermostat to turn off the camera when an intruder enters the house because it just triggers on motion and not identity or you forget to turn it on when you leave, which of course defeats the purpose of having a security camera in the first place.

Now if you just want it to watch your dog or cat during the day it will probably work just fine. I know the reason I purchased the Dropcam was as a security device and the ability for it to arm itself automatically when I left home and turned off when I arrived back was essential. I'm going to see if I can get my money back since they (Nest) has changed, to what I believe is, an indispensable and critical feature.

Up until the time Nest broke what was a very good product, I would have given 5 stars. I genuinely liked the Dropcam Pro product. Now that they have broken a common sense feature there really isn't any point in purchasing this product for the price since so many do the exact same thing with similar feature sets.
