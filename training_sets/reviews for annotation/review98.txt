Like the TV, has easy setup and great picture. My only complaint is an LED line of light at the very top of the screen, about 7" long. It's like the outside frame doesn't quite cover the screen. Doesn't detract too much, but a little annoying. I have not contacted customer service yet, but need to. I'm in a foreign country, so not too sure what they will do.
