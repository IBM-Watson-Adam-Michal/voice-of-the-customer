Just received those, and they are unexpectedly good. Very solid sound isolation compared to other similarly priced headphones. I'm no sound expert but music and podcasts sound great for the price. I will update this review in a year to comment on durability.EDIT: more than a month later, the right plastic part that holds the speaker part broke. I notified amazon and they immediately sent me a replacement with a one-day shipping. Be careful using these headphones as these seem to break easily. But Amazon's top-notch customer service more than made up for it.
