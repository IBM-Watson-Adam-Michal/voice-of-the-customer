his camera is fantastic for the price. I have had a few digital SLR's in the same price range (Olympus, Canon) but never a Nikon. After hearing good word of mouth about the product (clarity, megapixels, ease of use) I decided that I would take advantage while it was still on sale and purchase it. It has only been a few months since having the camera and I feel the need to take it with me everywhere I go! I have gotten some quality shots and the case is a nice add on. Now I understand it when people say if you go Nikon, you don't go back! Great buy, especially for a beginner/intermediate photographer!

ï»¿These shoes feel wonderful, like you are running on a cloud, BUT...., I've only had them for a month and the purple on the bottom is already worn through to the white part. I only run about 2-3 miles 3-4 days a week. They should not have worn down this fast. I'm really sad cuz I really loved this shoe
