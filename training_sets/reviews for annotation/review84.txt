Had the tv for 2 months and enjoyed.. shipping was fast...tv stopped turning on. Called TCL for warrenty repair.... hour on the phone trying to understand service rep.... was told they were shipping parts to me then would have a technician come out... a month later parts and technician showed up... he could not fix tv... still do not have a working tv going on 6 weeks.. no urgency at company at all and attempting to talk with them on the phone is almost unbareable.. spend a couple bucks more for better quality tv and customer service.
