m a headphone junkie so I have a good collection of all types of headphones. Sound is still subjective, but I know if something sounds "good". That being said, these are a definite upgrade from any headphone of the previous line of beats. Why it took so long for good sound, is beyond me. But these definitely sound good for nearly every genre of music. Now, its not going to rival open back headphones for sound stage, but most closed back headphones wont anyway. The price is for sure a bit steep, but they are definitely a step up sound wise, look good and the special editions have metalic type bands, which equate to good build quality. Beats headphones are polarizing and I hated the old line (most specifically the studios which sounded like complete garbage) but this new line up definitely sounds good, not just in comparison to the old line, but in general. Definitely give em a shot if you have the cash and looking for some flash.
