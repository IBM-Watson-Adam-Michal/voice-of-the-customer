Had some issues with the TV, had these odd blurry blue streaks running throughout, bit were mainly visible after tv was in and had dark or black image, then I couldn't "un see" it. However, AMAZONs incredible customer service brought out a replacement and then took the detective TV back, so I was never without. Resident replacement TV works great no issues, but purchaser should be aware of POSSIBLE problems. Replacement TV gets 5 stars, the first one gets 1. Amazon customer service gets 6 stars!!
