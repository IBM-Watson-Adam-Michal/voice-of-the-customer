First of all I am not a defendant in the Seattle Amazon lawsuit nor have I been paid the princely sum of $5 to write a five star review. Amazon's customer service should be a paradigm for the internet industry as when the first order was damaged in transit by the USPS, Amazon immediately sent an overnight extremely well packaged replacement by UPS. We currently operate 5 HDTVs and this is the best one I have ever used. Setup was simple. The picture is beautiful and the smart tv functions work perfectly. It is called a Super HDTV by Samsung due to new technology and I am sure once we receive more 4K broadcasts that the true performance will sparkle. In my opinion Samsung is always a step ahead of its competitors .
